Sweeney is from a largely rural district and has always been pro-sportsman and pro gun. Two years ago, there were a lot of anti-gun bills that were proposed in NJ's Senate. Senate President Sweeney promised that if he was elected, he would block every one of these bills from even making it to committee. He was elected and immediately combined all 21 anti-gun bills into one big anti gun bill, put his name on it, and pushed it quickly through the NJ Senate. It passed both the NJ Senate and NJ Assembly but was thankfully vetoed by Governor Christie. Christie vetoed it because he's pretending to be anti-gun so he can be president. Sweeney pushed it through because he wants to be governor and the rest of NJ is anti-gun so he needs to be anti-gun too. The Shenanigans The NJ 2nd Amendment Society (NJ2AS) is having it's big petition drive tomorrow. They need 35,000 signatures to force a recall vote. They have enough volunteers that each person needs to get about 60 signatures. They have walking routes already mapped out for each volunteer with only houses that are likely to be sympathetic and likely to sign a petition. The location of the training tomorrow morning was a secret until today. This was to prevent Sweeney's people from having time to interfere with the event. The secret location was an indoor sports facility called Total Turf Experience. The location was booked and paid for 2 months ago. The owners knew what the event was about and were supportive and wanted to help out. NJ2AS received a call this afternoon from                                Total Turf Experience     that the event was being cancelled. It's worked out okay, the group scrambled and found a new spot to train 600-800 volunteers. The recall goes on. Coincidences Interestingly enough, these items were discovered today. Seems that Senator Sweeney has some ties to Total Turf Experience and that the whole offer to host the event was made just to derail the recall effort. Senator Sweeney was present at the groundbreaking for Total Turf Experience                                                                                                                                                 Senator Sweeney was present for the grand opening for Total Turf Experience                                                       Some guy named Joe Sweeney is the lead website developer for Total Turf Experience (bottom of the page) This is how politics is done in NJ!

Jobs relates stories about his life, including his work at Apple as well as his public departure: I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods in my life. Jobs, of course, later returned to Apple when Apple purchased NeXT (also founded by Steve Jobs). Wow, I didn't realize Job was doing this - would have been a great speech to hear and experience. We didn't have anything like this for our graduation. Ok I will be good this time. It is nice to see Jobs beign so involved with higher eductaion. He sure made getting fired sound as not a bad thing. Think Different Compared to GWs speech about being a 'C' student and becoming President -- this somewhat outdoes that Lame Yale address, and proves a drop out can become a true leader who truly empowers individuals and changes lives...... That part about the pancreas cancer and the doctor telling him he only had 3-6 months to live, then finding out it was actually a curable cancer was really something to read. Wow Steve is amazing, I really wish I could have been there for it but then again i dont go to Stanford. Just finished reading it. Next year is my senior year at college, man it would be sweet to have him come and talk at my school (I highly doubt it though, I go to the University of Vermont, I don't we quite have the same budget). Steve's partner went to UC, Berkeley... As a cal student, this is blasphemy! Steve, this is unforgivable! Video clip: And Steve's return to Apple was the best thing that ever happened to the company. Very strange to stand up before a graduating class and say one of the best decisions he ever made was dropping out of college lol Video clip: Thank you for that. Watching it was all the more inspirational. I like this quote... Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. Steve's partner went to UC, Berkeley... As a cal student, this is blasphemy! Steve, this is unforgivable! don't be such a Weeny you can always start using windows... Damn good speech Steve. Keep fighting the good fight. makes me wanna go to work... After watching the video, it's strange to see Steve reading because at the Keynotes he is so smooth and passionate, this felt very rigid. I still don't get how he could be fired from a company he started.... I still don't get how he could be fired from a company he started.... That's happened to a lot of people, actually. It's not as strange as it initially seems. After watching the video, it's strange to see Steve reading because at the Keynotes he is so smooth and passionate, this felt very rigid. After seeing the clip, that was my first thought too. I assumed before I saw the speech that Steve had memorized it. The speech was very inspirational though. He really delivered for Stanford. Stanford has posted     the text of Steve Jobs' recent commencement speech from Stanford's 2005 graduation speech. Jobs relates stories about his life, including his work at Apple as well as his public departure: Jobs, of course, later returned to Apple when Apple purchased NeXT (also founded by Steve Jobs). Enjoyed reading his speech. Steve makes some very good life points. Connecting the dots... When he came back to Apple, he was hired for $1 per year. That was it. Until the BOD gave him the airplane and then other items. He was following his passion the gravy followed. Sushi Ummm.... ....shouldn't this be the iTMS free download of the week or something? nice! it really touched my heart. Everything is meaningless compared to death. Wow, damn lucky Stanford students! For 365 days a year I do NOT want to be a Stanford student, but this year it's only 364 days!

Like someone else said, how long do you want to spend making sure more transistors go onto a chip? I believe that the move to Intel is a sign that retirement is impending, guessing within the next 5 years. Moving to Intel was a bold move in anyones book, and probably the best chance Apple has to become the world's biggest computer company. After all as Steve Jobs said himself, it's about the software, and who gives a better software experience then Apple? And what better note to retire on? Call it the final stand, swansong, whatever. Which is why I think the switch to Intel has a little more to do with Steve Jobs himself than IBM's roadmap. Maybe but I don't think the Intel switch has anything to do with it. Steve's a pretty unique CEO so it's pretty difficult to say how far he'll go age-wise but I'm guessing he'll still have a presence at 60. If only to see a pay rise from his single dollar income. Now that I've got your attention... He's currently 50? Like someone else said, how long do you want to spend making sure more transistors go onto a chip? I believe that the move to Intel is a sign that retirement is impending, guessing within the next 5 years.

Which is why I think the switch to Intel has a little more to do with Steve Jobs himself than IBM's roadmap. 50 is pretty young to retire. 50 is pretty young to even be a CEO. I doubt it will happen in 10 years. I don't think his ego will allow him to retire. He enjoys what he does too much and has said so. He's not interested in retiring, as he has too many things he still wants to accomplish. In other words: No. Time. Soon. his chances of retiring are the same as the chances of theo epstein retiring This sounds sorta like Netcraft confirming that Apple been dying for the last 20 years. Apple isn't about money for Steve its about ego, I doubt he will retire before 65. While he could step back a little at some time in the next couple decades, like stop doing the keynotes, barring a major health issue, I can't see him retiring either. If there was some new challenge for him I could see him jumping ship and taking on a new company, but just retiring bacause he's old? Not a chance. He's not. I doubt he would voluntarily retire before 75. 50 is pretty young to retire. 50 is pretty young to even be a CEO. I doubt it will happen in 10 years. I don't think his ego will allow him to retire. im only 19 and CEO of my very own company                                                            but does that count for a 1 man freeware game making company? AND i earn significantly less than $1 per year. try nothing but seriously. i doubt Jobs will retire for a while yet. he's hoisted Apple up and i doubt they'd let him go quietly. He's got it pretty easy, I'd say, even with the international travel My money's on the 65-70 range if Apple stays in the black, and I can't say about Pixar. When you love doing something it's never work or a job but a way of life for those people and hardly about money, more an idea being brought to life. Since he still has things to accomplish (what they might be?) he will be around for a long time to come with Apple, after all it was his in the first place and now it's the second time around I can't see Steve Jobs retiring anytime soon.

{"doc_id": "ENG_DF_001471_20060203_G00A0275Q", "document": "Alternate History 2: Steve Jobs Is Never Fired Ok all you analysts, here's another question for you. What would have happened if Steve Jobs had never left Apple to start with? Do we still have a world controlled by Microsoft? Do we see the iPod come much earlier? Does Apple still go to the IBM PowerPC chip or switch to Intel a long time ago? Would Apple have been able to pound Microsoft into the ground? Or do things still slip into the terrible mid 90s that we saw. Let me know. My guess is that Apple gets torn apart. THere was so much in fighting and disagreement. It would have been messy. Ironicly, Steve being fired was the worst and best thing tha happened. I honestly think that Apple would have died. Like the previous poster said, there was so much fighting and disagreement. Plus, I think that leaving and establishing other companies helped focus Jobs' talent into what we have today. I am not sure that the Mac would be in the state that is today if Jobs hadn't left. Steve hired John Scully as CEO in 1985 because Apple was in desperate need of \"adult supervision.\" Scully brought the experience and discipline required to run a major corporation, but what he lacked was the vision for the future of technology that Jobs has always possessed. When the relationship between Jobs and Scully broke down, and Jobs departed, this was a bad day for Apple. The business end of Apple was run very well thereafter (some of Apple's most profitable years followed), but Scully never really had a strategic direction the company, so in that respect, it floundered. Jobs and Scully could have made a very good team, had they stuck together. I think Apple would be a much stronger company today had the split never occurred. Apple produces the best machines in the world, charges $10,000 each for the entry level model, and goes out of business in 1 year. Apple produces the best machines in the world, charges $10,000 each for the entry level model, and goes out of business in 1 year. lol straight to the point. Oy. I thought this might be at least a semi-serious discussion. If steve Jobs was never fired apple would of gone under. I seen some infomation on it and from employees at apple at the time agreed that if Jobs need to go for a while. Yeah it hurt and it was a dark day since the guy who took over lack the vision that Jobs had. Jobs biggest problem is his ego. And that ego was destoring the company. Huge mistakes where made by him (spliting the apple 2 and the mac devoloment and causing a lot of tension and so on) In the long run it was a good thing Jobs was fired. He need to get away from having influnces on the company for a while. He was to personly involved. After while of not being with the company let it gets a buniness side in order. When they brought him back Apple corpate side was in order and the problem was it lack of vision. Jobs has a great vision but his corparpated mind is weak. Now apple is in good shape they have both. The only problem deals with DRM and apple not trying to push for a standard. Longer they wait the more likely M$ will be setting the standard for DRM If steve Jobs was never fired apple would of gone under.

Yeah it hurt and it was a dark day since the guy who took over lack the vision that Jobs had. Jobs biggest problem is his ego. And that ego was destoring the company. I watched Steve Stanford Commencment Address and he said the same thing basically. He hated being fired, but it needed to happen. Are we forgetting...? Steve hired John Scully as CEO. I'm not sure what position Steve was in when Scully canned him, but Steve Jobs was not running Apple at the time, Scully was. So no, I don't see the factual basis for arguing that Apple would have gone under if Steve had stayed on, because, again, Steve Jobs was not running Apple at the time -- he'd hired John Scully to do that.", "event_args": [{"start": 41, "end": 45, "trigger": "Fired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 150, "end": 153, "trigger": "left", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 155, "end": 159, "mention": "Apple", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 619, "end": 623, "trigger": "fired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 607, "end": 611, "mention": "Steve", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 808, "end": 814, "trigger": "leaving", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 862, "end": 865, "mention": "Jobs", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 978, "end": 981, "trigger": "left", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 966, "end": 969, "mention": "Jobs", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 990, "end": 994, "trigger": "hired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1018, "end": 1021, "mention": "1985", "role": "time"}, {"start": 984, "end": 988, "mention": "Steve", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1334, "trigger": "departed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1290, "end": 1293, "mention": "Jobs", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1741, "trigger": "produces", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1728, "end": 1732, "mention": "Apple", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1775, "end": 1781, "trigger": "charges", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1728, "end": 1732, "mention": "Apple", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1865, "end": 1872, "trigger": "produces", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1859, "end": 1863, "mention": "Apple", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1906, "end": 1912, "trigger": "charges", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1859, "end": 1863, "mention": "Apple", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 2105, "end": 2109, "trigger": "fired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2235, "end": 2236, "trigger": "go", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2222, "end": 2225, "mention": "Jobs", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2312, "trigger": "took over", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2580, "end": 2584, "trigger": "fired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2571, "end": 2574, "mention": "Jobs", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3139, "end": 3143, "trigger": "fired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3269, "end": 3270, "trigger": "go", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3256, "end": 3259, "mention": "Jobs", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3338, "end": 3346, "trigger": "took over", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3489, "end": 3495, "trigger": "Address", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3550, "end": 3554, "trigger": "fired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3535, "end": 3536, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3610, "end": 3614, "trigger": "hired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3604, "end": 3608, "mention": "Steve", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3688, "end": 3693, "trigger": "canned", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3681, "end": 3686, "mention": "Scully", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 3937, "end": 3941, "trigger": "hired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3816, "end": 3820, "mention": "Apple", "role": "entity"}]}]}

Does anyone see the correlation between Steve Jobs and Robespierre? In that, Robespierre essentially became the French Revolution and Steve Jobs is the same way with Apple computer. id rather see if anyone posts something before i keep talking. cheers Now that you mention it - yeah, it does sorta seem that way, doesn't it. Umm, the French Revolution was an ideological movement, in which Robespierre went overboard and enforced it violently. Apple Computer is a company that was co-founded by Steve Jobs, kicked Jobs out, and then got him back as CEO. How are they related at all? I honestly can't think of anyway in which they're related, even distantly. And by the way, I'm a history major. lol oh no the history major has spoken. i enjoyed the brief recap you gave about the revolution and apple's history but that wasnt what i was going for. im strictly talking about the two men themselves. As the french revolution proceeded, Robespierre came to associate himself more and more with the essence of the conflict at hand. In the revolutions worst years, Robespierre was often noted to speak of an illness he acquired, he said that his life was not interwoven with the revolution. through the massacres and even the terror, Robespierre defended these acts b/c he was convinced that they were needed for the revolution to really come to fruition. i believe Robespierre compromised himself to become this greater cause, and went to extreme lengths to excuse the revolution and allow it to proceed uncontrolled. extreme? yes. but i feel robespierre really did come to represent the cause and errors that were the revolution now i say robespierre and jobs are alike b/c jobs seems to be apples own \"personal representative\". Like robespierre, jobs is known for being difficult to work for. strictly b/c jobs refused to compromise the goal of apple in any way, and robespierre did the same by excuses the murders. the two characters persist in thier cause and like wise meet opposition from within thier own cabinet. thats some of what i think oh and btw im a history major two, well double major with biochem.cheers Umm, the French Revolution was an ideological movement, in which Robespierre went overboard and enforced it violently. Apple Computer is a company that was co-founded by Steve Jobs, kicked Jobs out, and then got him back as CEO. How are they related at all? I honestly can't think of anyway in which they're related, even distantly. And by the way, I'm a history major. Yeah...I'm no history major, but I am a student of AP European History and... ...Robespierre = bad. You think the French would invite Robespierre back after he was gone 5 years? No. I hope Jobs isn't guillotined!!! I still don't think that the two are that similar, although I do see what you're saying now. Robespierre became the French Revolution, whereas I think it's more that Apple Computers became Steve Jobs. Robespierre wouldn't do anything to compromise the Revolution, whereas Jobs has to do everything his way. The Revolution was an ideology, so one could subscribe oneself to its inerrancy. Apple Computers is a company and has no ideology. Jobs cannot believe that Apple Computers is inerrant because Apple Computers is whatever he makes of it. Instead, Jobs, if he believes in the inerrancy of anything, believes in the inerrancy of himself. EDIT: You know, I probably should mention that I haven't done French history since high school, so... If you have any comparisons of Apple Computers to, say, Eastern Europe between 500 and 1800 or the Byzantine Empire, I'd be much better at responding. Yeah...I'm no history major, but I am a student of AP European History and... ...Robespierre = bad. You think the French would invite Robespierre back after he was gone 5 years? No. I hope Jobs isn't guillotined!!! i think he was somewhat necessary in the early stages of the revolution but its just so disapointing how he didnt use his power as he should. not that he played the dictator (altho there is a clique of historians who do believe so) but that he didnt stop the atrocities around him. I get what you mean, but I don't think it's the best analogy. First Jobs has to massacre thousands of people?? Yeah, see the difference?

(1) Please provide links to articles describing the abuse. (2) How would you expect people to respond anonymously? [edit: never mind... wasn't a poll when I responded] My answer depends on what measures Apple had taken to ensure that the company were following Apple's supplier guidelines (ie any monitoring or just laissez-faire) and what measures they take now that lapses have been admitted - both against this company and to ensure that similar problems aren't happening at any other supplier. (1) Please provide links to articles describing the abuse. (2) How would you expect people to respond anonymously? here's the link    . Not sure how we could \"punish\" them... Not a good situation though, for sure. China has labor laws? It doesn't seem like Apple is abusing anything. I chose \"NO: I don't really care\" because, honestly, I don't. I could have picked \"NO: I am concerned but will let others punish them\" but I suppose what's closest to what I really feel is \"NO: I don't really care because others will punish the OEM suppliers if need be.\" I think it's naive to assume that any other manufacturer doesn't use OEM suppliers which do the same thing. I won't stop buying Apple products because of it. If they were grinding small children up to make the casings or whatever, then, yes, maybe I'd care, but, as it stands, nothing I do will stop those workers from being abused by that company. If I stop buying Apple and buy some other supplier's system, then I have no proof whatsoever that such a purchase will in any way reduce any sort of labor abuse. To think that not buying Apple products will (a) alter Apple's opinion at all and/or (b) will in any way positively affect those workers is wishful thinking. China has labor laws? It doesn't seem like Apple is abusing anything. Actually, there's a really interesting article in the Guardian last Saturday which proposes that Chinese labourers actually have better labour rights than British workers!! I would stop buying Apple products if nothing changes. Globalization is bad... I would stop buying Apple products if nothing changes. Globalization is bad... Ummm... OK. You realize of course that almost every electronic device you own has Foxconn components inside it? That'll include your TV, your clock-radio, your microwave, certainly your car and possibly your washing machine as well. Generally, wherever a cable plugs into a socket, the likelihood is that Foxconn made the socket. Look at the label on the inside collar of your shirt - it will say Malaysia, Vietnam or China... made under the same or worse factory conditions. Even if you choose sustainable forest lumber from North America, the nails you use to build your house out of likely came from China.

I would really love to know what people think of Apple using a company in China that has abused its staff by overworking them. Please answer honestly and remain anonymous if you like. A rather vague and emotive way of putting it. Apple doesn't own any of its factories in China, it sub-contracts to them. The allegations made in the press have been that Apple have been using sub-contractors who under-pay and over-work their employers. These sub-contractors also are also used by other electronics companies. A subtle difference but an important one. This does not excuse Apple from taking any action if it hears of any unethical practice by any of its sub-contractors however. I would like to think that Apple would take action agaist any contractors that abuse human rights. Remember that Foxconn isnt just based in China- it also has a factory in Czech republis, where Mac-minis are made.

Cinderella's Disneyland Protest     True to the Cinderella story line, Cinderella is not getting much sympathy from the authorities with her Disneyland protest. Instead, police vans showed up to haul Cinderella and her fellow strikers off to the pokey. In addition to Snow White and Tinkerbell, Cinderella was accompanied by 29 other Disneyland Hotel protesters. Snow White arrested after Disney protest     Snow White, Cinderella and Tinkerbell were among 32 Disney characters arrested at Disneyland, after taking part in an industrial protest.

Certainly, theres no CEO more associated with a company than Jobs with Apple, but unless the other members of the management team go totally nuts, the Apple brand will remain strong. Posted on                                   MacBytes.com Approved by Mudbug Interesting.... We'll see about that. It didn't work out so well last time... We'll see about that. It didn't work out so well last time... But last time Apple didn't have the expertise in place like it does now. Steve has a Apple going in a great direction and as long as they stay on track they'll be successful for years to come. All it has to do is keep doing what its doing, which innovating some of the best products on the market and stay ahead of the game. I guess it sounds easy to say, but thats what they're currently doing. We don't necessarily need Steve Jobs to do that. There are plenty of very talented people at Apple to keep this going. Again, this wasn't necessarily the case from the mid-80's to the mid 90's where they executed great on all of the wrong things. They just had bad leadership. Apple did have poor leadership during the '80s and '90s, but one of those poor leaders was Steve Jobs. Even Jobs recognized his limitations, which is why he hired John Scully. The fact that he was able to return to Apple after 12 years as such a completely transformed corporate leader is one of the greatest stories in business. But it's incorrect to believe that Apple went downhill because he left in 1985. If Jobs had remained in charge of Apple at that time, he might well have run the company into the ground. Brands are based around leaders, I could reel off thousands of companies who have had a very strong brand, had a leadership change, and then gone through the floor and sometimes even closed. If this wasn't true, then the share price of Apple wouldn't have plummeted on the news of Steve's ill health. I really hope the team that successes the current board doesn't mess things up because Apple's in a good place at the moment, with $20Billion in the bank, im sure only a few oil companies and maybe Microsoft have those kind of free resources. Apple now has more free cash than Microsoft ($25 billion), but mainly because Microsoft is now paying a dividend to stockholders. I don't think brands are based around leaders, they are based around companies and products. Even in its darkest days, the Apple brand was one of the most recognized in the world. Brands are based around leaders, I could reel off thousands of companies who have had a very strong brand, had a leadership change, and then gone through the floor and sometimes even closed. If this wasn't true, then the share price of Apple wouldn't have plummeted on the news of Steve's ill health. I really hope the team that successes the current board doesn't mess things up because Apple's in a good place at the moment, with $20Billion in the bank, im sure only a few oil companies and maybe Microsoft have those kind of free resources. I don't hardly think that brands are based around leaders. Thats totally untrue. Sure, Steve Jobs is known to a lot of tech people, but the general everyday consumer? No so much. Try going into an Apple Store and asking a first time non-technical person who Steve Jobs is. You will most likely get a lot of \"I don't know\" answers. People don't buy Apple products just because of Steve Jobs. If he left, people will still buy Apple products if they're good products like they are now. I could personally care less who is in charge of Apple. As long as they're making kickass products, I'm buying them. Brands like Coca-Cola, Nike, Disney are all extremely popular brands around the world with a very loyal following just like Apple has. But those people don't follow Disney for example because of their leader. They follow because of the products (or services) that company produces/serves.", "event_args": [{"start": 87, "end": 91, "trigger": "views", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 74, "end": 91, "mention": "Opinion/Interviews", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 293, "end": 298, "trigger": "leaves", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 300, "end": 304, "mention": "Apple", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1564, "trigger": "hired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1613, "trigger": "return", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1580, "end": 1581, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1622, "mention": "Apple", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1799, "end": 1802, "trigger": "left", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1796, "end": 1797, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1810, "mention": "1985", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2558, "end": 2563, "trigger": "paying", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2579, "end": 2590, "mention": "stockholders", "role": "recipient"}, {"start": 2497, "end": 2505, "mention": "Microsoft", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 2567, "end": 2574, "trigger": "dividend", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2579, "end": 2590, "mention": "stockholders", "role": "recipient"}, {"start": 2497, "end": 2505, "mention": "Microsoft", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 3500, "end": 3504, "trigger": "going", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3530, "end": 3535, "trigger": "asking", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3661, "end": 3663, "trigger": "buy", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3648, "end": 3653, "mention": "People", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 3714, "end": 3717, "trigger": "left", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3711, "end": 3712, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3738, "end": 3740, "trigger": "buy", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3720, "end": 3725, "mention": "people", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 3876, "end": 3881, "trigger": "making", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3868, "end": 3871, "mention": "they", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 3905, "end": 3910, "trigger": "buying", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3912, "end": 3915, "mention": "them", "role": "thing"}, {"start": 3901, "end": 3901, "mention": "I", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 4190, "end": 4197, "trigger": "produces", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4182, "end": 4188, "mention": "company", "role": "agent"}]}]}

If any of us really gave a flying s*** about sweat shops we wouldn't buy the iPhone or any products made in factories like foxconn. But get real, every one of you and myself included will line up, put down our credit card and without thinking twice spend more in 5 minutes than those poor schleps make in an entire month. We rant an rave about the atrocities of slave labor and the abhorrent history of our country and plantations, but then we have no problem whatsoever supporting the fleecing of human life in China and elsewhere in the world, with our own personal dollars, yes you are perpetuating this type of human pillaging even today. I don't have a problem calling myself a hypocrite, because unless I stop spending my money on this crap, then I am a hyporcrite. That goes the same for every one of you, especially if you call yourself a liberal. I am conservative, but I think liberals buying iPhones are actually even more hypocritical than me, cheers! No, it won't stop most people from buying an iPhone. But it is indirectly Apple's problem. Not exactly. It's not Apple's factory, or as your analogy calls it, \"plantation.\" It's Foxconn's.

Just read this article online To sum it up many workers at Foxconn experience horrible work conditions as a result of trying to complete demand for various different tech devices by companies like HP, Nokia and Apple. In order to reduce the stress that's put on workers, monologist Mike Daisey, suggested that consumers NOT update devices as frequently. Thoughts? To sum it up many workers in third-world countries experience horrible work conditions as a result of trying to complete demand for various different products for first-world businesses. Fixed that for you. Apple isn't alone. Fixed that for you. Apple isn't alone. I never said Apple was alone I even stated some of the other companies mentioned that employed Foxconn. Yup and I don't lose sleep over it I know apple factories are not pleasant but no other company treats their employees well either, I think as consumers we need to make the choice of buying things made in North America at a higher price vs. things made in China at a lower price. With the costs of many things going up I do not think we as consumers can afford higher costs. I, purposely try to buy things made in Canada or USA. We are all to blame at this mess- consumers wanting cheap goods, Wal Mart and other big box stores importing things, and the chinese governments openness to these horrible factories. Also manufacturing of goods in china dwindles the jobs in America. Also stuff made here lasts longer and is better quality. Another video about foxconn: go to youtube and search foxconn- the first one foxconn lies. not much the consumer can do when the products they want are produced under these terms... all computers are made this way I think as consumers we need to make the choice of buying things made in North America at a higher price vs. things made in China at a lower price. With the costs of many things going up I do not think we as consumers can afford higher costs. Hypothetically speaking, say that we as consumers refused to buy products that were made under these conditions. As you predicted the result would be that the prices would go up but say consumers refused to pay the higher prices. Something would have to give, so what would be the result? Would the companies just go out of business? Or would the companies be willing to take a hit like instead of bringing in over 50% profits on each iPhone sold Apple would settle for less? not much the consumer can do when the products they want are produced under these terms... all computers are made this way Well according to the article you could help out by not buying a product as soon as a new one comes out. Well i'm not entirely certain the impression that I got was that the conditions are especially harsh because the company is trying to meet increasing demand. If people didn't swarm to buy the newest product every time they are released the demand for products wouldn't be as high and the workers would not be worked as hard. Isn't replacing \"When the next on comes out.\" and \"is no longer current\" the same thing? I replace mine when it is no longer performs the tasks I want it to or need it to perform. If it has failed I replace it if the cost to benefit ration of a new model outweighs the cost to benefit ratio of repairing it. Though I generally buy used products at a heavy discount over new. Excepting those where age or wear and tear make a huge difference in useful life vs cost. Or were used has little cost benefit over new. Anything heavy duty and mechanical I definitely buy used. That way I can buy something that is top of the line and built in the USA or other first world nation. Rather than some cheap POS built in China. I'll take my Kirby vacuum and Kitchen Aid Pro Series mixer over something cheap built in China. They'll withstand more use and abuse plus have a much longer overall lifespan. Sure some well made stuff can come from China. When the company contracting insists on the factory to meet stringent quality standards.

Hope you all like it. I try to have some good Tech coverage. Recording Record Profits, Apple Must Manufacture in USA Why Apple needs to bring back some manufacturing to the United States. So... why? Has the average American worker suddenly become more globally competitive overnight? What is Apple's incentive? THIS is the ONLY question that matters. A few points about article. It is well written and logically structured. I only skimmed it, but I only caught one typo (look for 'tought') However. While you mention the quote from the NY Times about how it wasn't the cost of labour that gives China it's edge in attracting the assembly jobs, but the flexibility in creating supply chains and the flexibility of the factories - you don't really address the issue. Your article talks about how China bent over backwards to create a factory for Gorilla glass. In contrast, compare that to a story on the MacRumours front page where Apple's campus in Austin wants to expand, but the various levels of government can't agree on what level of incentives to provide. Your article also ignores the statements that in China can recruit several hundred low-level engineers in a matter of days, if not hours. Basically, engineers with a technical college diploma. While in the US it would take them weeks if not months to recruit those numbers in a community where they could also afford the land. So.... while Apple may be able to recruit those engineers in LA or NY.... could they afford the real estate to locate a factory there? And in places where they can afford to locate a factory, are there enough engineers who already live there or who would move - at their own expense? Many parts of an Apple device are in fact manufactured in the US.... primarily chips. It's the assembly that is happening in China. Nonetheless, a lot of spin-off supplier benefits are in the US. And finally.... just because they can... why should they? One of the reasons the US was able to become so rich was by opening up other countries to American trade. Often those countries were reluctant to give up their own domestic manufacturing in exchange for American imports, and the US would bully or even use force to open them up to \"free trade\". Free Trade is Free Trade - and the USA can't just decide to change the rules because it is now being out-compteted. Learn to compete... don't close the gates. I would point out that Samsung says one of the main reasons they built their chip factories in Austin Texas, is because of the quantity of talent available from the local University of Texas Engineering School. However, I don't believe the need for \"hundreds of engineers\" at Foxconn. I think it was more like the need at the time to satisfy Steve Jobs' desire for instant re-manufacturing whenever he wanted a last minute change. Unions killed that idea 50+ years ago. The average North American worker is longer interested in working as hard as factory workers do in China. I would point out that Samsung says one of the main reasons they built their chip factories in Austin Texas, is because of the quantity of talent available from the local University of Texas Engineering School. However, I don't believe the need for \"hundreds of engineers\" at Foxconn. I think it was more like the need at the time to satisfy Steve Jobs' desire for instant re-manufacturing whenever he wanted a last minute change. I think the 'hundreds of engineers' needed is directly related to the tens of thousand of assembly line workers that Foxconn has employed. The more I read, the more I am convinced those of us in the \"western world\" cannot conceive the scale of production needed to produce these devices. 250k employees in one factory?!! That is a small city by our standards--where, hypothetically speaking, every man, woman, and child is employed in one facility.

If Apple can ship 40,000,000 units a quarter, every quarter, that puts minimum capacity at roughly 400,000 units a day. Minimum. We know they can do this. If they are now quoting shipping times of 30 days from now, how many units in the backlog? At the minimum capacity number, that would be 12,000,000 units on back order, but we all know the 40,000,000 per quarter is not a maximum number. How many units a day do you think is maximum capacity? At 500,000, that would equate to 15,000,000 currently on back order. At 600,000 that would be 18,000,000.... Now the ship date and back orders won't be exactly accurate, but it has to correlate to some degree. Safe to say I bet the # of backlog orders that Apple hasn't accepted is 2x as many as they have. Demand for this thing is insane. The math isn't that simple, otherwise any random schmuck from the MacRumors comment forums could do Tim Cook's job. Some of the manufacturing capacity would be in clearing the backlog of existing orders. Other portions of the manufacturing capacity would be allocated to building inventory for the launch in new markets. Also, there is a production ramp. The Day 1 manufacturing yield will not be the same as the Day 300 manufacturing yield. The contract assemblers improve their procedures and yields as time passes. Additionally, Apple is quite aware of seasonal variances in product sales. If Apple needs 40 million units for Q4 CY2012 and 25 million units for Q2 CY2013, they will communicate this to Foxconn, Pegatron, etc. It would be up to the contract manufacturing partners to staff accordingly. Apple isn't going to pay a factory of 60,000 workers to twiddle their thumbs for one quarter and neither is Foxconn. It would be up to Foxconn to retool the manufacturing line for another client or for another Apple product line (e.g., iPad). It's not a flat, steady demand every single day of the year. Except the historical shipments are relatively flat quarter to quarter, so though it's not as simple as I've laid out, it's not rocket science either to take a reasonable guess at capacity. I read another post where someone stated with inside knowledge that capacity was only 150,000 units a day. Clearly that's off by at least 250,000 units... I'm pretty sure Apple is gonna sell 50 million iPhones from this weekend to Dec 31st. Except the historical shipments are relatively flat quarter to quarter,... Citation needed. Simply googling iphone shipments per quarter finds graphs that suggest a far different picture. Two examples: And the Wikipedia one has a table, with links and references to primary sources. I read another post where someone stated with inside knowledge that capacity was only 150,000 units a day. Clearly that's off by at least 250,000 units... No, 150K per day actually sounds about right for capacity around launch day. Assuming a five-week (35 days) pre-launch production ramp at 150K units per day, that would mean 5.25 million units in available inventory on launch day. And guess how many units Apple sold the first weekend? Just about that much, and                                                                                                  Apple executives claim that their sales figures were supply constrained    . That would explains why people who ordered online on Sunday or Monday are still their orders \"in processing\" (or whatever the wording is). With a 150K capacity, clearing the backlog will take a while. If Apple can ship 40,000,000 units a quarter, every quarter, that puts minimum capacity at roughly 400,000 units a day. Minimum. We know they can do this. If they are now quoting shipping times of 30 days from now, how many units in the backlog? At the minimum capacity number, that would be 12,000,000 units on back order Well, no because the entire manufacturing capacity is not sent out to orders from their online store.

At least their not jumping off buildings this time. Foxconn, a contract manufacturer to Apple, closed a northern China factory for the day following an early Monday riot that, according to the company, began as a fight between workers. Details remain scarce. The company said several people were injured and sent to the hospital after the incident, and that some were also detained by police. The factory in question employees about 79,000 workers. Other reports, however, described a riot possibly involving as many as 2,000 people and, by one account, potentially sparked when a guard struck a worker. Photos posted by a user on the Chinese Internet service Baidu depicted lines of helmet-clad riot police surrounding what appeared to be workers and rooms littered with detritus and glass from broken windows. Earlier this month, a Shanghai Evening Post journalist claimed to have gone undercover at the Taiyun plant. He described his orientation, plant security and his job, which was supposedly to manufacture the back plate of the iPhone 5. Back in March, the head of human resources at the Taiyun factory reportedly told a South Korean newspaper that Foxconn had \"just got[ten] the order\" for the iPhone 5. That was just a few weeks after a reported strike involving hundreds of workers over a pay dispute at the Taiyun plant. We'll update this story as we know more. Updated 8:46 p.m. PT: with more details. I have to ask myself: Does more excitement on the customer's side (for the new products) result in more pressure on the worker's side? Edit: there's a video about it. At least it's not the Taiwan parliament (they fight too). Surely it's about them getting \"good pay and equal share\". In the article quoted, there is no mention that the riot was caused by workers wanting more pay. For all we know it may have been rival gangs, or the settling of old disputes between ethnic minorities, or about some bullies pushing in line at the cafeteria. hopefully we don't have a similar issue as last time.

Ive doesn't have the temperament to run a complex cooperation like Apple, Scott Forstall is still unseasoned, Bob Mansfield? Peter Oppenheimer? Philip Schiller? Who would *you* suggest? Without any inside knowledge, this is an impossible question to answer. Apple stock is doing fine, so the market seems to disagree with you. Steve is reported to have had input on years worth of Apple's future product line. It is unreasonable to think he wasn't involved in the new iPad. The iPad name had to drop the number because of the new iPad Mini line. Sequential numbering doesn't work well for two simultaneous models. iPods, iMacs, MacBook Airs, MacBook Pros, Mac Pros, Mac Minis, and Apple TVs all do fine without a number tacked onto their names.

{"doc_id": "ENG_DF_001471_20121217_G00A02LVB", "document": "White Dudes Keep Mass Murdering People Have You Noticed That White Dudes Keep Mass Murdering People? When anyone who isn't a white and relatively well-off man strides into a public place and guns down innocent civilians, we attack his race and/or religious beliefs before we bury his victims in the ground. But when yet another privileged white guy storms into a school or movie theater and kills dozens of people, we assume there's something wrong with his brain instead of wondering whether his murderous rage has anything to do with good ol' American macho entitlement. Are we ready to talk about it yet? Let's. This is hardly the first time we've questioned what makes white middle-class dudes more prone to shooting up public spaces; last summer, after the Aurora movie theater massacre, Hugo Schwyzer wrote that \"the fact that these white male mass murderers felt so confident choosing public spaces to commit their crimes reflects a powerful truth about the culture in which they were raised.\" When Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people at Virginia Tech, pundits instantly declared that his Korean upbringing had something to do with it. When Maj. Nidal Hasan went on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood shootings, we heard more about his Muslim faith than anything else. Yet, when David Sirota suggested on the Sunday morning edition of \"Up\" with Chris Hayes that the same conservative politicians and commentators who support racial profiling when black people or Muslims are the ones being profiled would rather sacrifice a few of their semi-automatic weapons than think critically about white men, the right-wing media freaked the **** out. I find it sadly hilarious that when this latest white dude shot all those people, the American headlines didn't mention terrorist at all. If this dude was Muslim/black/asian, you would have heard that we need to bomb yet another country because of our racial prejudice and the need to get rid of all non-White \"terrorists\". I think some of these guys are Manchurian Candidates being used by our good ole government to help push its gun control agenda. It's more effective when they create the problem, which in turn prompts us to demand the \"solution\". Reverse psychology on a large scale. -- Or as the saying goes: Order out of Chaos Anyone who thinks this is far-fetched thinking, seriously needs to open up a history book. Gotta agree. The dust hasn't even settled and Obama is already talking gun control. Keep in mind a few things in play: Go to Africa and you'll find non-white dudes killing thousands. Secondly, you have to recognize there is a different reference point between society's view of those who are \"dominant,\" and those who aren't. Long under attack, the \"White guy,\" is considered still the race/sex that has every thing easy. You can't really say it was his \"culture.\" However, it plays better if it's the underdog who's trying to fight the power and this was their, \"last stand.\" I'm in Asia and the last headline I saw was, \"He was a Hard Core Call of Duty player,\" and I just thought, \"What a crock of ****.\" I have thousands of hours into Call of Duty, Black Ops, Rainbox 6, Saints Row, GTA, etc, and I would never have the urges this guy acted upon. I think some of these guys are Manchurian Candidates being used by our good ole government to help push its gun control agenda.

I'm an IOS user because I value the quality of Apple's products, and the security they offer. I'm afraid that Google is following us more than they should be allowed to. Every website has Google Ads, and it occurred to me that Google can make a map of everything we do on the internet. Google ads are on almost every website, and the only way we can opt out of Google altogether is to not use the internet. It's almost impossible to avoid using something made by Google. I've always wondered what kind of data Google collects, and have been trying to learn about this kind of thing, by reading all news that I find on this topic. I was wondering what you guys think. Do you mind Google recording everything you do online? Do you think France and Germany should ban Google's services that violate our privacy rights? Should we be protected from this kind of tracking? The articles below talked a lot about this topic, and I wonder what fellow Apple owners think. I wish Apple would release a search engine and computer advertising so we wouldn't have to worry about this stuff =/ Google's 'Project Glass': A Huge Threat To Privacy? How Europes Fight with Google Over Privacy Ignores Real Privacy Google must defend privacy policies to 6 European agencies Google's Legal Problems In Europe Could Hurt Earnings Google's privacy woes are just the beginning You seem to be making Google out to be a bad guy and Apple to be the hero. I think it's naive to think Apple is all innocent or any company for that matter. Plenty here have too must trust in Apple. Don't get me wrong, I like Apple...OS X. And Google with Android. Works great despite what you'll hear from some users. Honestly, I think you're being a bit paranoid. Yea it we're being tracked. Call it Google, call it Facebook (aka: Big Brother). Heck look at your iPhone, how do you know nobody's listening to you or watching you? It has a built in mic and camera! Just because it's off doesn't mean it's off. You don't know who has connections to your phone and who's doing what with that data. Is that possible? I think so. But technology comes at a price and I don't mean money... No I don't wear a tin foil hat. Personally I think this is ridiculous. Every single company that is involved with software, the Internet, mobile devices, search and advertising is tracking you. I have never heard of a single case where someone was harmed because of this. Whether from Google or any other big company like Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo or Bing (MS). I just haven't seen it. I think you should be careful with your information but other than that, I don't worry about it. Use Bing for search and give Microsoft some piece of your information. Finally we will not avoid that kind of tracking as Google and others mainly generate income from ads. Not that I'm feeling too comfortable with it and for example don't log in to Google when I search with them. And I use privacy setting etc. finally nothing to hide... Or we say by-by to free Internet and pay for each search and email ? Privacy policy?? I wish they had one! Just wait until the day when the insurance companies demand information on what kind of diseases you have googled over the past few years. \"Nothing to hide\"? Personally I think this is ridiculous.

My brother in law is a firefighter here in the DFW area and last night he was called in to help with one of the more local departments who were on the scene.

It must have been incredibly loud for the kid to lose his or her hearing at that distance. Man that was terrible! Been reports that the blast was heard 45 miles away. Registered as a 2.1 earthquake. I don't so much think it was the loudness of the blast that caused her to lose her hearing. It was most likely the pressure differential and sound blast that cause the temporary hearing loss. I heard a report on the radio this morning that this explosion registered on the richter scale at a 2.8. That is rather amazing (and disturbing) when you think about it. I don't so much think it was the loudness of the blast that caused her to lose her hearing. It was most likely the pressure differential and sound blast that cause the temporary hearing loss. That makes sense. Thanks. Do we know if this was an accident or other yet? It just seems far to coincidental. The Waco anniversary is right round the corner. I'm sure the next time dad asks who wants to go watch fire at an industrial plant whose materials are used in large bombs - the kids are going to ask if they could just stay home and toss lit firecrackers at each other. More fun, and safer too. Sympathies to the families who have lost loved ones, their homes, their livelihoods. I don't know for sure but could be that the neighborhood built up around the plant. OK, I'll restate my question. Who the hell builds up homes, schools and nursing homes near a fertilizer plant? OK, I'll restate my question. Who the hell builds up homes, schools and nursing homes near a fertilizer plant? The same people who complain about the noise of an airport when they move in. OK, I'll restate my question. Who the hell builds up homes, schools and nursing homes near a fertilizer plant? People that work near there that don't want a long drive? This has been a bad week for America. OK, I'll restate my question. Who the hell builds up homes, schools and nursing homes near a fertilizer plant? People who can't afford to buy elsewhere... OK, I'll restate my question. Who the hell builds up homes, schools and nursing homes near a fertilizer plant? West is not a large town. The plant was probably one of the major employers in town, so some people might want to have lived nearby. As big as that explosion was, you probably didn't need to be very close to it for your house to sustain some damage. Several confirmed dead so far, with dozens more feared to have the same fate.

MSNBC interviewed the local Congressman about the proximity of the plant to schools, homes, a nursing home. He said it was a 'wakeup call'. Really? This is not the first time a fertilizer plant has exploded. In many, many cases rules, regulations, zoning, are written in blood. From my time spent in aviation, this is definitely the case for airlines. It's been reported that the plant owner when going over emergency contingency plans, did not acknowledge this could ever happen. Of course, it would cost money such as buying out the surrounding neighborhoods or moving the plant somewhere else. Wow, that was a pretty amazing video.

In 1999 the highest winds every recorded was associated with an F5 twister, 318 mph, in the same vicinity near Oklahoma City. I wonder what happens to the population count after an event like this.

I don't understand one thing here, this is already the 3th time this happens in the same area yet these houses are still built out of wood. Not only there but in the whole Tornado ally, where I am from houses are built out of brick (solid) and double walls with insolation in between, so much stronger.

{"doc_id": "ENG_DF_001471_20130729_G00A01RYW", "document": "Banks and the control of Aluminium Link;                                                                                                                                http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/b...t-to-banks-pure-gold.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Basically many banks have begun buying all the factories that produce and distribute Aluminium. A desired Metal, from which Iphones and Macbooks are made of. What the Banks do is that they have increased the weight time for companies to get a shipment of Aluminium from 3-4 months, to 16 months. They drive these trucks of Aluminium through \"check ups\" between warehouses almost endlessly. Why? Aluminium is a great product and near irreplaceable. For what purpose? Much like the diamond industry, they can manipulate supply and demand, and rise the prices. If it's suddenly harder to get a hold of Aluminium everyone has to pay more (Apple, Coca-Cola etc) to all the people in the banks who own these Aluminium factories. What do you think? Could there be a link? Since Apple can't use another metal alloy with the same benefits as Aluminium, doesn't it make sense to make a cheaper more mass produced Plastic version, while keeping the Aluminium products in the higher pro-consumer bracket. They can make lot less of them, so they need a lot less aluminium compared to if every entry Iphone or Ipad was made from Aluminium. With a 200 Dollars less device, maybe only one/8th or one/10th of a device would be made from Aluminium, allowing Apple to get away from these banks chokeholds of a desired ground material. Hopefully this forces Apple to bring back the glass / stainless steel design of the 4 and 4s for future iPhones Aluminum is quite crappy when it comes to scuffs since its so soft First of all, in comparison to automotive, building or food and drink industries around the world, Apple use of aluminium is minimal - tiny drop in the ocean. Secondly, let's not forget about Apple acquisition and recent patent for Liquid Metal manufacturing. There are always alternatives... Hmm i thought the wait before was 3-4 weeks. I think the cost of Aluminum and it availablity has little to do with Apple's products. If we use millions of aluminum cans each day, many that are tossed away, we need not worry. Aluminum is one of the most common metals in the Earths crust and we've gotten good at extracting it from ores, so I don't think there's some conspiracy to cut the supply... Or blame the Zionist banking corporations for the cheap iPhone! Down with the Rothschilds! Aluminum is one of the most common metals in the Earths crust and we've gotten good at extracting it from ores, so I don't think there's some conspiracy to cut the supply. Agreed. This is much ado about nothing. Aluminum is one of the most common metals in the Earths crust and we've gotten good at extracting it from ores, so I don't think there's some conspiracy to cut the supply... What does one have to do with the other? If the supply to buyers is being constrained then the prices can be raised by the sellers regardless of how much raw material is available. Classic examples being diamonds or oil. For example, OPEC can manipulate fuel prices up or down by how much oil they ship regardless of how much is still in the ground. Unless end buyers of aluminum get into the mining and processing business it doesn't how much ore is in the ground. It only matters how much usable material is available in the marketplace. I would be surprised though if this had anything to do with Apple presumably using plastic for the rumored economy-class iPhone. Back in the news: U.S. Subpoenas Goldman in Inquiry of Aluminum Warehouses By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI To give an idea of the scale: Industry analysts and beverage makers estimate that long queues cost manufacturers and consumers more than $5 billion. Kinda like Office Space - a few cents from each transaction is hopefully hidden from the end user, but aggregated they total billions. $5 billion across 300 million Americans is \"only\" $16.66 each, but it's still more than we would have allegedly paid otherwise.

And has hired Mike Elgan. More from Leo. He wants a full time in house news director. And has hired Mike Elgan. Mike Elgan? Seriously? It sounds like that the Tom not working in the same studio was hampering the production of the show. Skype can only go so far, at least it seems for this situation. I can't say this is a good or bad move until things shake out a bit more. Tom Merritt - Understands tech and genuinely loves talking about it. Sarah Lane - Boring, distracted, Nearly clueless about tech and seems to only work at TWiT to fund her globetrotting vacations I'm sad that Tom was let go but I understand why they had to do it. But what has always been a puzzle is why they continue to keep Sarah Lane on board. I'm sure she's a nice girl (well, not really because she seems pretty condescending) but for a Tech commentator then she just seems so disinterested in everything tech. It doesn't sound like Tom was fired per se, but that his contract wasn't renewed and the fact that his distance and therefore lack of presence in the studio had more to do with it than Leo's ego. This of course is based on what Leo wrote in those two blog posts. Call it what you will, but I don't view it as he's be 'fired' as in let go because of wrong-doing. Unless Tom speaks out and gives a different story, that's what I choose to believe. As for Mike joining the team I'm sure he'll do a good job. I'm not a huge fan of his, but I don't dislike him either. Sarah is fine host IMO, but I only watch her on iPad Today and no other shows. Leo said he wants a real news division. So far all they do is read stories off the web. Elgan is supposedly a great journalist so will they do more in house reporting and investigative stories now? I agree that Sarah is dead weight there, she would make a decent host but has no business reporting on tech. So it looks like Leo's ego got in the way again as he fired Tom today. To me it sounds more like he let him go, since he wasn't in house and wasn't local. The Skype thing was only going so far. Doesn't sound like a firing to me at all. Sarah Lane - Boring, distracted, Nearly clueless about tech and seems to only work at TWiT to fund her globetrotting vacations Though I think she does prep for her shows I would agree that she is not Twit Tv's strongest hosts technically. It just sounds like they want someone a bit more full time I am sure Tom will do well.

Following this ruling, the activists can pursue a tort claim that alleges Google misused their private information. The Honourable Mr Justice Tugendhat writes in his decision: \"I am satisfied that there is a serious issue to be tried in each of the Claimants' claims for misuse of private information... The Claimants' application to rely on ground (9) in relation to the DPA [Data Protection Act] claim is allowed... the Claimants have clearly established that this jurisdiction is the appropriate one in which to try each of the above claims.\" This case stems from Google's former practice of installing cookies in Safari even when the web browser blocked that practice. Google circumvented the browser's default privacy settings by tricking Safari into thinking a web page was a trusted page. Google did this through code embedded in its ads that made Safari think the user was submitting a form. When a user fills out a form, Safari makes an exception in its privacy policy and allows a cookie to be installed on a user's device, and Google exploited this exception to install cookies without the permission of the user. Graphic from The Wall Street Journal Google halted this practice in 2012 after it was reported by The Wall Street Journal, but consumers and regulators pursued the case through several investigations and lawsuits. The company                                                                                                                           was fined     $22.5 million by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for this privacy violation and paid                                                                                                                                   a $17 million settlement     in a case filed on behalf of Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia.

Next up, everybody else who thinks its a good idea to take personal information without permission...*COUGH*... NSA. I'm all for privacy, but where does this cash go? The company was fined $22.5 million by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for this privacy violation and paid a $17 million settlement in a case filed on behalf of Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia. Why are 37 states getting paid because Google screws me? I admit I have little knowledge on the UK court system. However - my only question is - what damage occurred and is that an important metric to prove in order to win a case. Where is our share of the cash when we are the actual victims instead of some of the states and not all of them? Google's going down! I'm sure they'll get a stern talking to and some serious finger wagging! I'm all for privacy, but where does this cash go? Why are 37 states getting paid because Google screws me? The idea is that having to pay a fine stops Google from doing it again. So the important thing is Google paying out. Who receives it is secondary. Does anyone know if Apple has made any changes to Safari to prevent others from exploiting the same approach? The idea is that having to pay a fine stops Google from doing it again. So the important thing is Google paying out. Who receives it is secondary. By this logic, the company that killed someone by a poor product only need to pay the government and the actual victim is only secondary? Him...don't know if I can agree to that. The idea is that having to pay a fine stops Google from doing it again. So the important thing is Google paying out. Who receives it is secondary. Paying a fine of $22.5 million means nothing to a company like Google, like paying $10 to the average person. There is nothing about the amount that would deter them from doing something like that again. It is ironic that Google got rid of their motto \"Don't be evil\".

North Korea claims it has successfully detonated a miniaturised hydrogen bomb. The test took place on Wednesday at 10am local time (1.30am GMT/Wednesday 12.30pm AEDT/Tuesday 6.30pm ET) at a known nuclear test site at Punggye-ri. An announcement on state television claimed the test “worked perfectly” and was “self-defence against the US having numerous and humongous nuclear weapons”. If true, this would be North Korea’s fourth nuclear test, and its first using a hydrogen bomb, significantly more powerful than an atomic bomb. There has been no independent verification of North Korea’s claims. An artificial earthquake of magnitude 5.1 was detected close to Punggye-ri. Japan has condemned news of the test, labelling it a threat to Japan’s security. There's no evidence of this being genuine outside of North Korea's claims. I'm skeptical, but it's best to proceed with caution. Was curious about the thoughts here. Update: A organization of the UN that monitors for nuclear activity stated that it detected an \"unusual\" even as well. The UN organisation monitoring the world for signs of nuclear testing confirms it has detected “an unusual event in the Korean peninsula”. The head of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation, Lassina Zerbo, said: Our international monitoring system detected an unusual seismic event in the Korean peninsula at latitude 41.27 longitude 129.10. The location on the map places the epicenter at North Korea’s Pyunggye-ri testing site in its north-eastern mountains, where all of its nuclear tests have been conducted.

Yeah, North Korea has a hydrogen bomb. I also get as hard as I did when I was 20. On a side note, I guess fish can't really get embarrassed when they fart as its obvious when they do and they would just do it in front of each other like its normal behaviour. We need tolerance like that up here on concrete. There's no evidence of this being genuine outside of North Korea's claims. I'm skeptical, but it's best to proceed with caution. Was curious about the thoughts here I imagine our nation's intelligence and photoreconnaissance agencies will be in for some long hours in the days ahead trying to establish what, exactly, went on in North Korea. The \"good\" things about nuclear testing is that with modern technology, its possible for our analysts and scientists to gain a pretty clear idea of exactly what sort of weapon was tested, even though they cannot gain access to the site itself. Airborne sensors will take air samples looking for particular isotopes, and specifically the mix of such isotopes, to look for clues as to the process. Other scientists will look at the seismological data to determine how the explosion (if any) took place; and to gain a better idea of the potential explosive yield of any such device. My guess is that North Korea detonated some form a a fission weapon that was successfully \"boosted\" with the addition of Tritium. Such \"boosted\" weapons, while terrifying and powerful; are a long way from the almost unlimited power and complexity of a full fusion weapon. It seems unlikely that North Korea would be able to engineer a full fusion weapon without first conducting a far more comprehensive test program than they have previously.

This is one of the few things I give Texas a lot of credit for. I hate living here and (but for the friends I've made, who are also transplants) would to leave. But, business is business - which is another thing they do well, but not the point here.

Hire inherently violent, unemployed and aimless minorities already whipped into an anti establishment frenzy by Obama to agitate and intimidate, then when the **** hits the fan, blame it on the rhetoric of Trump and claim the hired thugs were just peaceful, grass roots protesters who were innocently protesting and attacked by angry mobs of neo Nazi whites. So it would behoove those of us interested in the rule of law and 1st amendment rights to find ways to prevent these anarchic 3rd world rented left wing urban terrorists from doing their dirty work in this once great nation of ours, and a couple ideas come to mind. Charge anyone entering $20 and require legal, state issued ID. That would ordinarily filter out about 99.9% of them, but with the Soros funding, they could easily get around the $$ barrier. State ID barrier not so easy, that should filter out at least half to 75% of them. Add a requirement that those with felonies will not be allowed in, then we are back up to the 90% region in many locations, add drug screening and consistent 100% nation wide,,, But that would take alot of pre planning to accomplish, something not always feasible in campaign rallies. Then, they can \"peacefully protest\" outside until their cold little lizard hearts are content, and the $$ raised by the rally would be donated to charity. Any more ideas ? Can't trust Trump with the money. He says he raised $6 million for veterans yet only ~$2,000,000 of it has been donated. I don't think the funds earned from your stellar idea would ever make it out of his pockets. EDIT: Corrected 200,000 to 2,000,000. Trump should just rename his rallies job fairs. Charge anyone entering $20 and require legal, state issued ID. That would ordinarily filter out about 99.9% of them, but with the Soros funding, they could easily get around the $$ barrier. State ID barrier not so easy, that should filter out at least half to 75% of them. that may take out most of his supporters. Intimidating protestors paid to arrive in droves contrasted with Obama about to empty jails of convicted felons.... Coincidence? Donald Trump charging $20 to go to one of his rallies? Well it certainly would remove all doubt: Trump supporters have to be the most gullible saps on the planet. And it would add an extra tinge of seediness to Trumps glowing reputation as a con-man and rip-off artist. Think Trump University writ small. But it would do nothing to prevent people from protesting outside the facilities. Where most of last weeks protestors were located. The thought of a having to face huge crowds of people holding up banners decrying racism; xenophobia; and hatred probably will keep at least a few of the Trump suckers home in their trailers. I do love the George Soros paranoia in this thread. There is creepy                                                                             Protocols of The Elders of Zion     element to the whole thing. (Question: Has anyone actually claimed they got paid to protest at Trump's Chicago fest?) The thing that stinks to high heaven is the revolting racism. The assumption that african-americans and latinos couldn't afford $20. The assumption that they don't have \"state-issued\" local ID: At the Chicago event many of the protestors were local University students.

She is caught speaking about emails and not wanting to use govt emails due to wanting to keep from having them come up in investigations later. She is exposed. No wonder she wanted to hide her server. No wonder she deleted all her emails. The video also shows how Clinton's claim that she barely knew Peter Paul was false, and how she under reported contributions by him by millions. And the left's response: and the right is foaming at the mouth. Fine. Let us elect Bernie then. So I see we're all trusting the MSM today. Actually having watched the video, I am not sure she's admitting much. Management at my institution often will not use e-mail because it leaves a paper trial. You just know when you're getting a phone call that it's going to be a crap day. However, using alternatives to e-mail is not a crime. I am sure most of the people in Congress and running for President have done exactly the same thing. \"She knew it all along\"? What is \"it\"? The video is from before the 2008 election, before she ever knew she was going to be Secretary of State. Honestly, do you ever tire of spewing argle-bargle? Yes, as much as I distrust Hillary, I'm not sure this proves anything. It's pretty much common knowledge not to write an email of something you don't want there to be a record of. It also suggests nothing of government email specifically. In the broad context of investigations, her personal email can be used in investigations - just as it is now. Even without a warrant to investigate her server, if someone recieved an incriminating email from her and submitted as evidence, then you still have evidence of a paper trail. Although it was long before she became Secretary of State, it shows that back then she was concerned with hiding incriminating information from potential future investigations. Good find.

Posted on 04/19/2016 11:08:46 AM PDT by                              real saxophonist The Denver Broncos have lost their two main quarterbacks from their epic 2016 Super Bowl Championship winning season. We need a proven winner to continue to move this team in the right direction. Coach Gary Kubiak's offense would thrive with Tebow under center. He and the legendary John Elway can make this happen. We dont need a subpar throwaway from some other team, we need an original Bronco who has the fire, desire, and love of the game to play as a Bronco again! As a bonus the Bronco fans would be ecstatic! He just wins, we all know this! #TebowTime use the links below to view more comments., use the links below to view more comments., Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

I don't care about the Broncos, but this might provide an entertaining respite from all the Trump/Cruz stuff. Post or flame away! I'm still really pissed about what the media did to Tebow. Every time I read an article it was some leftist hack trashing Tebow for being Christian. I don’t think the NFL would let a team sign Tebow. They are more interested in players with the character of Manziel or the special attraction of Sam. Send Johnny Manziel along with him. Elway hates Tebow. It won’t happen. Ah if he only had the talent to play at the pro level. But the author didn't specify that so maybe he doesn't think it's necessary? Tebow puts Elway under conviction. Besides he might run for a Florida House seat. Sorry, but Tebow is considering a run for the retiring Ander Crenshaw’s House seat. Today the House, tomorrow the Governorship! Shades of Heath Shuler Not trying to offend anyone here, but Tebow maybe should have tried another position. He was a gifted athlete, but NOT an NFL calber QB. He could run over people, but couldn't throw consistently to even be a second string QB. When he was cut by New England, I knew what I suspected was simply true. Love the guy, but I don't think he was black balled because he was a Christian. That ship has sailed. Let it be. Something happened between him and Elway, and it wasn’t just Payton Manning. Turns out Manning was a good decision on Elway’s part, but he sent Tebow out with a bad referral to other teams. I still cannot account for that. &gt;Ah if he only had the talent to play at the pro level. But the author didn’t specify that so maybe he doesn’t think it’s necessary? He played well enough to get a win in the playoffs. The better than vast majority of Pro QBs. Tebow was a decent ball control QB that could win games with a strong defense and he certainly played better than Manning did last year. Tebow’s primary problem is he’s just not smart enough to be a pro level QB and lead a team effectively. He’d make an excellent tight end. Elway is a turd. As long as he just has to run for the seat. If he has to throw for the seat then he's in trouble. But this describes Tebow as a quarterback. Denver will end up with Colin kaepernick I wouldn’t cost the Broncos anything to tell Tebow “come out to Spring training and show us you are better than Sanchez”. I might even get them some publicity. But realistically, even after his self funded passing coaching, he’s probably not better than Sanchez. LOL! ... because Christians are known for the inability to read defenses and aren’t very accurate passers. &gt;Denver will end up with Colin kaepernick Another QB too dumb to play in the NFL. Poor Broncos fans. Last time I checked neither Sam or Manziel was on a team roster. Just like Tebow. before the Trump war, there was the Tebow war.... While I'm sure that San Francisco is kicking themselves for keeping Kapernick and letting Alex Smith get away it may be too late for the trade. Denver has Sanchez now. They're looking for a backup for him. &gt;As long as he just has to run for the seat. If he has to throw for the seat then he’s in trouble.

Hmmmm When a state has turds line Haley Barbour and Thad Cochran, nothing more need be said. The MS GOP is among the worst of the lot. Lol. Welcome to lawsuit hell if they try. Once upon a time I liked Haley Barbour, no more. Is this against the rules? So this person sending the text says they are going to try to elect Trump and Cruz supporters? I forget, who won Mississippi? Is this something that shouldn’t happen? “Once upon a time I liked Haley Barbour, no more.” Once upon a time, I thought the GOP was an honest, conservative political party that was interested in doing good things for our country, but no more! That’s interesting. I’d like the MS state GOP guys to point out the statute that would allow arrests for displeasing political party officials. Haley thinks Mississippi is his own cash machine Anyone goes there it's like West Virginia with Robert Byrd so many Government projects it will make your head swim No one complained about Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi they got rebuilt better than ever. “Haley thinks Mississippi is his own cash machine” Haley is Mississippi’s “Boss Hogg!” If they ever do a remake of “The Duke’s of Hazzard,” Haley has a role! Just get him a whte hat and outfit. He’s fat enough to fit perfectly! We took a trip to the Alabama coast three summers ago. Rarely saw any signs that they had even had a hurricane. Then the next summer we went to Mississippi. Not much restored, particularly the wonderful older homes on the Gulf. Evidence of damage from the hurricane remained everywhere. Lots of shells of construction projects that were never finished. We did notice some minimal expansion and rebuilding when we went back last summer. By comparison between the two states in just the Gulf area, Mississippi is way, way behind. An the Barbour crime family at its best Lol... On what basis? They themselves do not want to go to prison and they know that once the GOP-e organized criminal organization is taken down, that will be their destiny. The Mississippi GOPe is among the worst bunch of scumbags there are. Mississippi ping That’s because Katrina did not hit Alabama. Geez...look at map will you? Well, EXCUSE ME. You might want to chill just a bit. Why in the heck should Islander7 need to chill? Your post was ridiculous. Alabama didn't get hit by Katrina. The eye actually made landfall in Louisiana. Mississippi took the brunt of the storm. It amounts to the difference between being slapped and KNOCKED OUT! Please do your homework before passing judgment. bump!

He's a bi-racial politician. He was the best choice out of the two.....and quite frankly I don't think he can walk on water - don't want him to, just want him to try and figure out the mess that Bush left behind. Walking on water is probably the easier of the two. He's a bi-racial politician. He was the best choice out of the two.....and quite frankly I don't think he can walk on water - don't want him to, just want him to try and figure out the mess that Bush left behind. And that has what to do with my question? And that has what to do with my question? You asked about \"his\" election - and I made comment on \"him\" Has MLK's dream come true? That a bi-racial politician has been elected president? I don't know, I suppose. How's that? On MLK day, all the media seem to be going on about is \"does Obama's election mean MLK's dream came true?\" The very fact that they have to still ask that question tells me \"no\". Thoughts? Agree. I don't have much knowledge of USA politics but I don't recall anyone mentioning the colour of Bush's skin when he was elected. It's more like a nightmare You asked about \"his\" election - and I made comment on \"him\" Has MLK's dream come true? That a bi-racial politician has been elected president? I don't know, I suppose. How's that? So you read half the question and then replied to a questioin which hadn't been posed... OK... some things never change. If you didn't have an opinion, why post at all? Agree. I don't have much knowledge of USA politics but I don't recall anyone mentioning the colour of Bush's skin when he was elected. probably because out of 41 blokes to hold the office before him, 41 had the same skin colour as him probably because out of 41 blokes to hold the office before him, 41 had the same skin colour as him I thought he was 43. Bush and the thoughts of Mc Cain/Palin frightened the US so much the forgot about being racist probably because out of 41 blokes to hold the office before him, 41 had the same skin colour as him What colour was the other one's skin? What colour was the other one's skin? which other one? which other one? GWB was/is the 43rd president. According to your post, of his 42 predecessors, 41 had the same colour skin as him. What about the other one? Ping! Gerald Ford was not elected.... GWB was/is the 43rd president. According to your post, of his 42 predecessors, 41 had the same colour skin as him. What about the other one? Ping! Gerald Ford was not elected.... Bush is the \"43rd president\" but there have only been 42 actual presidents, including Gerald Ford. Good quiz question, this...... So you read half the question and then replied to a questioin which hadn't been posed... OK... some things never change. If you didn't have an opinion, why post at all? Because I'm annoyed that this is all tied into MLK in the first place. Yes, he's the first \"black\" president....but so much hoopla is being made over an elected politician for christsakes! Don't get me wrong, I'm glad he won, I voted for him. But I didn't vote for him because he was a black man, I voted for him because he was the better (IMO) of the two. Yes I know this is not really answering your question.....Is this fulfilling MLK's dream? The fact that he was elected, perhaps, the fact that he can run a government, one that's screwed up royally, well I guess we'll see.", "event_args": [{"start": 87, "end": 94, "trigger": "election", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 79, "end": 83, "mention": "Obama", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 275, "end": 282, "trigger": "election", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 267, "end": 271, "mention": "Obama", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1198, "trigger": "election", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1186, "end": 1188, "mention": "his", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1300, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1302, "end": 1310, "mention": "president", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 1419, "end": 1426, "trigger": "election", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1411, "end": 1415, "mention": "Obama", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1670, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1608, "end": 1613, "mention": "anyone", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1722, "end": 1729, "trigger": "election", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1717, "end": 1719, "mention": "his", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1831, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1833, "end": 1841, "mention": "president", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 1920, "end": 1926, "trigger": "replied", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1884, "end": 1886, "mention": "you", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2040, "trigger": "post", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2005, "end": 2007, "mention": "you", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2182, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2120, "end": 2125, "mention": "anyone", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2760, "end": 2763, "trigger": "post", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2755, "end": 2758, "mention": "your", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2878, "end": 2884, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2939, "end": 2942, "trigger": "post", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2934, "end": 2937, "mention": "your", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3057, "end": 3063, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3238, "end": 3244, "trigger": "replied", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3202, "end": 3204, "mention": "you", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3355, "end": 3358, "trigger": "post", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3323, "end": 3325, "mention": "you", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3521, "end": 3527, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3589, "end": 3591, "trigger": "won", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3586, "end": 3587, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3836, "end": 3842, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3816, "end": 3817, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}]}

{"doc_id": "ENG_DF_001503_20110828_G00A0GCON", "document": "We never expected to be in Dalby! We applied for our Visas way back in November 2005. Life got in the way and we had all but given up moving to Australia. But as the final leaving date rapidly approached we decided to throw caution to the wind! Jobs were resigned our belongings packed (very stressful - and shippers were crap) and tickets bought. We arrived in Sydney on November 17th stay with a relative for a couple of weeks. We travelled upto the Gold Coast as we had planned to live somewhere south of Brisbane. Our shipping container arrived weeks before the floods but we could not get to access our belongings due to customs. We had rented a house but we had no furniture so had to buy camp beds to sleep on, and garden chairs and table - we had an interesting Xmas. The Brisbane floods arrived and thankfully after a few days of anxious waiting we were told our container had survived the inundations. A month late our belongings finally arrived. BUT our boat which was also being shipped was due to arrive the same day as the floods hit. We got an e mail saying it had been left portside in Sydney as Brisbane port was closed!! Panic.... thankfully the Australian importers we had hired were fantastic and it was re shipped to Brisbane later at no extra cost. As teachers we had expected to be able to get jobs no problem.... wrong!! We now know that teaching jobs in south Brisbane simply don't exist as people simply do not move on.... We had been in Australia for four months and needed to do something radical to get work. We contacted QLD education and simply said where do you want us? James was offered a job in Dalby (2hrs inland from Brisbane) on Thurs and started the following Monday. He was given an education QLD house and moved in with absolute basics. After a few weeks of commuting to the coast to be with us (me and 2 teenage kids) we decided to break our rental lease move the kids out of the school they were attending and risk all for Dalby! We were not happy but we certainly were not ready to give up and move back to the UK. (Not that we could as all our savings had gone - car, rental deposit and rent as well as basic living and a very weak £. That was 6 months ago and we are planning to stay here for a few more years. I have since got a full time teaching job at the same school and the kids have settled despite moving schools twice in 8months. The school house is more than adequate and is situated on an agricultural campus with 9 other houses. The rent is dirt cheap and our savings are slowly creeping back up again. mostly as there are no restaurants to speak of and any decent shops are at least an hours drive away! The house we left in the UK is almost finished and our next door neighbours want to buy it for their parents. We are not where we wanted to be and the boat is unlikely to see the ocean for a while... but we are doing ok. There is always a silver lining if you look for it and we are now looking at buying an expedition camper and going off road around Australia as we have gotten a taste of the outback. Yee ha! Excelent post mate and just goes to show if you're prepared to try anything it can work out in the end Glad to hear it has all worked out (apart from the boat's point of view!) We drove from Sydney to Dalby to pick up our Border Collie puppy almost a year ago! Had never heard of the place before then. I liked it's rural charm! And was a nice drive from Brisbane up through Toowoomba. Enjoy it for what it is for now - you have got the rest of your lives ahead of you.... Glad to hear you are liking it out there. I went on a one day 'road trip' to the west of Brisbane with a mate from the UK a couple of years ago. We made it to Dalby and decided it wasn't going to get radically different for at least 1000kms so we grabbed a pint and came back One day I'll do the roving about properly", "event_args": [{"start":

I once bought something off eBay from China for a couple of hundred pounds, and had to pay about 85 Euros duty at the post office before they'd hand it over! Not quite such a bargain after all :-( Does anyone know the value limits for importing goods into Portugal from outwith the EU without incurring import duty? I once bought something off eBay from China for a couple of hundred pounds, and had to pay about 85 Euros duty at the post office before they'd hand it over! Not quite such a bargain after all :-( Not sure about the limits, but when based in Portugal and whenever we bought stuff off eBay outside the EU we would have it shipped to the UK first... second delivery address was family in the UK. They would then pay any taxes and ship in onwards. Another way we used to get around it was to have items shipped to Algarve Freight depot in the UK. They will pay any import taxes due and ship it onwards to Portugal. You pay taxes with the delivery charge on collection. We did that a few times also. It would always work out far cheaper and quicker than trying to deal with Portuguese customs. Trying to import anything into Portugal from overseas is a total Rip Off and Alfandiga (spelling?) damn well know it! The only free trade within Europe is between EU members imports from anywhere else can attract tax. Portugal is not doing anything different to the UK. Many people in the UK get a shock when buying off Ebay or Amazon when they get a bill because the product has come from outside of the EU. That is why you should carefully check where you are buying from. I'm not sure what the limit is; usually it's a few hundred euros, + a certain amount worth of cigarettes and a certain amount for booze. But that only applies when you travel. For mail order items, you [theoretically] have to pay duty from the first euro. It practice, they let a lot slide through, especially smaller parcels. But I've learned to order only from within the EU if at all possible. Things from outside the EU can get stuck in the customs queue for weeks or months. Then you have to pay duty + IVA on the item + duty + shipping. It just takes all the fun away. It's not worth sending anything to Portugal from outside the EU. It sits forever in customs and they make up the duty and iva as they feel fit. If you can have it send to another EU country and pay the extra postage and get it before you die. I have a camera sitting in customs since March, emailed them and only get automated answers. As far as the post is concerned, don't send or receive anything in August, you wait forever.", "event_args": [{"start": 53, "end": 61, "trigger": "importing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start":

That said, I am planning on shipping most items of Personal effects to Oz (to help offset initial relocating costs) Among my electrical and electronic stuff, i have rather good furniture (finished properly - not rough and untreated) such as King SIze Bed / 6 door wardrobe/ Sofa set/ Hutch etc. - can ship them? WOuld there be any reason I should not be bringing them even if they are good, fine and treated properly? That said, Can i bring Leather Furniture/ Sofas? Any help will be much appreciated Thanks in advance. We brought with us leather sofa, Pine wood bookcases and unit and bed frames as well as outdoor wooden furniture with no problems at all. We brought our 2 sofas, IKEA furniture, Sofa bed etc. We even brought our used dyson hoover (thoroughly cleaned of course) We also brought an LCD TV which worked fine with our english DVD HD recorder, until the TV broke after 6 months and then DVD didn't work and we only had sound with no vision Don't think TV's travel too well, as they're not that careful with the boxes, and we found our TV in it's box on it's side We also had to pay duty on it (around $350) as it was less than a year old. Didn't have any quarantine issues. Most household items/furniture will be fine. Anything that has untreated wood may not, depends on what it is. Our daughter's untreated wood doll's house and contents went through fine.

Our telly is 18 months old so no probs but our washing machine is only 3 months old. You should declare anything under 12 months old x Well I had a 40ft container of household items of furniture and most of it under 12 months old or new (bedding light fittings curtains etc). I then bought a rangemaster cooker and had that sent direct to shippers and none of this was declared as new and all went through without any problems. Customs inspected the container and never blinked an eye - even though several large items (cooker - garden settings etc) were all brand new and in original packing. Two leather sofas under 12 months old and a dining suite also included. the only items they actually looked at were christmas decorations and the kept two back because one santa had twine around him - oh and one bell had fake berries on it (go figure that one)!

That sermon that was held in the street that time by Abu whatisface. Beggars belief Speechless. Utterly despicable. To my mind this is no different (assuming it was a member of HM Forces who was attacked) than when the IRA were murdering members of HM Forces in the UK and Germany &amp; Holland.

They talk to a camera with the body lying in the background. It looks like they were waiting for the police. 2 nutters hack somebody to death and the PM is flying back to consider raising the Terrorist Threat Level to serious. What a ****** joke. Shocking incident, but I'm more likely to get killed by lightning than a terrorist, I hardly consider either as serious. Manipluating someones death to try and force more monitoring and laws on us. This was an absolutely appalling, sickening, barbaric murder. I can only feel for the family of that soldier if the film clip is being played in the UK as much as it is over here. Media outlets are positively salivating over it, which is almost as disturbing. Well ITV have just given the killers several minutes of air time showing one of them talking to someone filming him on a mobile phone.

It's ridiculous to suggest the media should not be reporting on this. And judging by what every British news channel and newspaper is running this evening, they agree.

I need some help, I'm trying to ship my power tools by sea to Australia as I'm an electrician, the problem is all of my power tools are battery powered mainly lithion ion and one Ni-Ca battery my shipping company ( seven seas ) says no batteries are allowed what so ever in the boxes that I'm sending because if customs found them they would confiscate them and charge to dispose of them! Does anyone know a way around this? Or any advise would be greatly appreciated !!! Thread moved as this is a better area to get you some answers My tools travelled, batteries and all, and customs inspected nearly all my shipment. If your packers wont ship them though, all I can think of is sending the tools, and taking batteries in your luggage - or shipping them separate if that's allowed. Thanks for quick reply, what shipping company did you use? We are trying to use seven seas but it just says \"no batteries at all\" and they couldn't really explain it any further when we tried ringing them. Thanks for quick reply, what shipping company did you use? We are trying to use seven seas but it just says \"no batteries at all\" and they couldn't really explain it any further when we tried ringing them. I used John Mason's from the UK. Can't recall getting asked about battery tools - I only have a couple of drills and screw drivers as the rest are corded, and it's not on the declaration paperwork. I shipped martial arts weapons, and the packers forgot to mark which boxes they packed them in, so customs opened about 80% of my shipment to find them and never confiscated the batteries. Just rang seven seas again &amp; apparently it is fine to ship why they couldn't tell us that yesterday I don't know! Cheers for help Just rang seven seas again &amp; apparently it is fine to ship why they couldn't tell us that yesterday I don't know! Cheers for help No worries - Good luck with the move. Where are you headed? Was going to say I shipped all my tools ( I am a carpenter) no problem and when I left the final few were sent air mail no problems at all. Lots of shipping firms will give the easy option - especially if you are just talking to a rep. The same with food, they often argue no food can be imported - its simply because its easier for them. The batteries may need to be declared, that's all, and it means the company just has to take more care ready up on some regulations.

Which is correct? Many people previously couldn't get coverage due to pre-existing conditions. They now cannot be denied coverage.

The bill is a compromise which keeps insurance companies happy. The current (pre-Obamacare) set-up means that uninsured people present at emergency rooms. If they cannot pay the hospital bill, they are driving up the costs for others. But some who are used to this arrangement prefer it to having to pay something.

In general, it should take around 6 months from start to finish for an AOS process. If you also applied for AP, you should receive a \"combo card\" with combined EAD and AP so you can use that to visit back home while waiting for your AOS to be adjudicated. Ah, in that case...never mind. Filing I-131 for AP doesn't complicate anything unless you are not eligible to use AP (you're in an overstay situation, for example). Now you might as well wait until you have your green card in hand. Filing the AOS package in August will put you at around Feb 2014 for AOS approval...unless you get an RFE, or unless the government shutdown affects you, in which case it could be longer. Rene Give me a shout when you get here, I know of another 3 Brits living here we can have a little Ex Pats club lool Thanks for the info Rene Just got an Email from USCIS, my I-765 has been mailed, unfortunately because of the shutdown I wont be able to get my SSN straight away. On the bright side I'm one step closer ... because of the shutdown I wont be able to get my SSN straight away. You don't need a SSN to look for work, accept a job, or start working.

Hey guys, I knowo this has probably been done thousands of times on other threads but unfortunately I am working flat out over the next few days then have a hospital procedure that will knock me out of researching for a while. Could people give rough estimations of what it will cost for this move. As most of you know I's be travelling solo and so paying only for myself, so I don't have anyone to keep me right or help with the research. My dad is going to help me to work out the best way of financing it all but wants me to bring him rough figures. So far I have the following; £2000 visa £350-400 medical $2000 (ish) bond for accom $2000 (ish) for first months rent before we start to get paid £700-800 (ish) for one way flight Im not planning on having anything shipped over at this stage, just me myself and I. Any help would be great thanks You'd be better off asking this in the main country forums for wherever you're going to - you haven't actually said in your post which country that is though! Oh yeah right enough!!! Haha oopssss! Hopefully Western Australia Just a suggestion - house share at start if its just yourself. You'll need a car. My friend hired a car via gum tree at a better rate that the hire companies when they first came but that was over in QLD. Have you got a job to come to? - it will take longer that a month to secure work if you don't have anything lined up. Heaps of Irish in Perth if that's where your going there. check out gum tree - but beware lots of scam on that site too. Good luck with visa etc. Poitin Yeah I would be joining the police, so a guaranteed job Oh yeah right enough!!! Haha oopssss! Hopefully Western Australia Your figures don't look far off Irish, maybe a little more on the visa cost Obviously some cash for food and travel before you get paid as well - are you thinking of purchasing a car here or using public? If you let an airline know you are migrating and have an unvalidated visa, you may get double baggage allowance - we did with Singapore and had 40kg each plus hand luggage which helps I know someone who moved to Canberra and shipped their car over. Is that a feasible option? It certainly seems like it could be much cheaper to ship your car and re register rather than buy/rent when you arrive. I was considering shipping the car over but then had heard it cost somewhere in the region of about £3k??

Hi everyone, Firstly a little background, i joined this fine site quite a while ago, and received a very warm welcome! but have not posted in a while (lurked a lot). My wife and i decided upon her renewing her american citizenship to move to milwaukee, WI. She is an american born abroad, so, blah blah, skip to the middle! She has been living there since january of last year, and i am currently living at my mothers tiny house (in the bedroom i grew up in! I have visited twice within that time, each visit lasting a month, now, my point is, my immigration process is taking so long! and i don't want to come across like so many posters who expect it to be immediate, but its been around eighteen months now and although it seems close to the end with a couple of delays, form resubmission (my wifes tax and earnings) its made us consider a couple of options, bearing? baring? in mind i've been doing some research and it seems that the government shutdown will potentially delay it even further! oh yeah, both options involve me quitting my job of twelve years, ulp! option 1; I go for the full ninety days, starting at christmas, which means i can spend christmas and wait out some more of the time there with my wife. option 2; which is a tad bigger and more in need of your guidance, is it possible to move there permanently and change or resubmit my visa as an adjustment of status instead? Obviously i'm not rushing into a decision by any means, it's just really hard for us at the moment as we've been together for nearly twenty years and this is the longest we've been separated since we were 18! sorry for the essay and terrible grammar, but opinions would be much appreciated many thanks Dave. Eighteen months seems rather long - do you know where you are in the process? What responses from USCIS have you had? USCIS is funded from the fees it charges so isn't directly affected by the shutdown. However, some steps in the process require action by other federal authorities such as FBI background checks, and they may be affected if they've not been done yet.

Hi rpjs, the last thing we submitted was the affidavit of support, twice because my wife got a new teaching contract in the time they took so her tax didn't match. that was in may, they haven't been forthcoming with info at all throughout the process really mainly through instructing us to wait for an email that never arrives, so we call them and they tell us we should have already done the thing we were waiting on the email for! really frustrating. and with my wife getting a new life sorted out on her own and all the complications that go with that, we've not been exactly hot on their heels, it has dragged it out a lot. but i would say we're in the final stages now, but it seems we've been in the final stages for nearly a year, since i submitted my big pack of documents Do you have a Lawyer involved? You are probably only 2-3 months away from the visa now, despite the fact that you have no further options open to you why would you want to stop it? The AoS from VWP is doomed to failure, since you are already married it's pretty clear you would have immigrant intent, and if the AoS was refused for any reason you would become immediately removable and possibly receive a ban. Stick with it - you're nearly there. Do you have a Lawyer involved? we lucked out there although only recently, a friend of my wife is an immigration lawyer! but she only met him very recently as i said I am curious to know how your wife renewed her American citizenship.

The only other thing i would likely like to use it for is MAME, but then i see the RetroPlayer feature in XBMC is going to support MAME ROMs and others.

Our container arrived recently and the NZ shipping agents have sent us a letter from biosecurity requiring two cars and two bikes to be steam cleaned. The charges seem pretty damn high. We have been quoted $600NZD for each car, and $275NZD for each bike. Particularly annoying was the fact that both the cars and bikes were cleaned before shipment. There is no way around this it seems. What made me laugh/cry was to avoid the $275 charge for cleaning each bike, we could pay $375 each for destruction!!! Ouch! exactly how did you clean them in UK...? Did you get the underside done? Ouch! exactly how did you clean them in UK...? Did you get the underside done? Cars and bikes were steam cleaned! Underneath and engine bay done for cars. And inside vacuumed. Push Bikes, or Motorbikes? I don't fancy having all my bikes (cycles) steam cleaned Push Bikes, or Motorbikes? I don't fancy having all my bikes (cycles) steam cleaned Bicycles. DAft question probably but did you provide the steam clean paperwork evidence when you submitted your MAF papers this end? DAft question probably but did you provide the steam clean paperwork evidence when you submitted your MAF papers this end? The international movers did all the paperwork (except the forms I had to fill in). We had the cars cleaned before taking them to the movers and they cleaned them again just to make sure. But we had no paperwork and I'm not sure if the movers provided any. Would this help next time? We have 2 other cars and a container still to go, so if I can avoid this happening again, I will get paperwork if it would help. Thanks for the tip. we had our car professionally cleaned, I photographed it being done and left the paperwork and invoice visible in the car before it was put onto the container at our house. as for bikes we cleaned with Vikal, I think it was called, recommended by the removal firm but hear that Jeyes is also good. as long as it smells bleachy and looks clean from my should be all good. but then again you won't know how long the container is going to stand still at anyone port, and what creepy crawlers are already on the container or will get on it so if MAF see cobwebs they are going to want it cleaned again anyway, thats my understanding Among those forms would have been the one where you declare anything that might be of interest to MAF and what you did to clean that.

Cars - steam cleaned by xxxx Walking boots etc. You would have filled that out and the Shipper would &amp; should have provided that to MAF with the rest of the paperwork.

I was charged $218 (plus GST) for a 'quarantine treatment' for my bike and a woollen floor rug. I hadn't cleaned either beforehand so I knew it was a risk. Also they had been in storage for 2 years so the bike had cobwebs on. The MAFF clearance certificate said they needed a vacuum and wash. Neither looked washed to me when I got them! Oddly, my garden furniture, which they checked but didn't clean, had cobwebs on too when it arrived. Thanks for the links BEVS. I don't think I completed that particular form but I did fill in an unaccompanied personal baggage declaration. It included cars and bikes but did not specifically ask about cleanliness etc, so I didn't state anything, nor did the shippers ask for any. Next time I will make sure to attach copy invoices for cleaning as MrsFychan suggests, and also send them with the baggage forms. I've been steam cleaning everything myself. I'm hoping this is okay as they don't smell of bleach! As for the car I've had one shipping company tell me not to bother with the underside, just take it to a hand car was as they'll want to do a the underside regardless of having been cleaned here or not.

Well you would get the most basic furniture, probably not all what you need, questionable quality (maybe I don't know), but in any case the bare bones of any household? No homely touches, soft furnishings? You generally cannot cramp all your personal effects into a suitcase, so you either leave behind or have to pay for some shipping anyway.

Also shows that Governments be they Provincial or Federal don't bargain in good faith with their employees. Also shows that Governments be they Provincial or Federal don't bargain in good faith with their employees. What does good faith mean? They are trying to get the best deal for the taxpayers and students while the union is trying to get the best for itself and its members. Both engage in the manipulation of public opinion to further their own interests. What does good faith mean? They are trying to get the best deal for the taxpayers and students while the union is trying to get the best for itself and its members. Both engage in the manipulation of public opinion to further their own interests. I find myself agreeing with you. Public employees do get a pretty sweet deal compared to private sector. Good faith means going into negotiations without telling the other party that this is what we are prepared to impose on you and if you don't agree we will legislate you back to work. Sure both use tactics to the benefit of whom they represent but Im pretty sure if the Govt came in and said Hey BC teachers we are reducing your wages by 25% take it or leave it Im pretty sure the taxpayers and students might agree with this. Would you as a teacher? There is always room for compromise and even the Unions understand this. Then all options in good faith should be on the table. We’ll give you the percentage raise you want, but you agree to work full time and and take four weeks holiday, that way we can recoup the money lost by charging for the classes you’ll have to teach in the extra two months. And how about giving back those Pro D. days and doing any further education on your own time and with your own money? I wouldn't say the teachers union bargains in good faith either, they can be pretty militant towards anyone who dares disagree with them. I'd have more sympathy towards public sector employees and union issues if the wages were inline with similar jobs in the private sector, but more times then not, they are paid a significant amount more with far better benefits. My ex-wife worked for the federal government, made mid 40,000 for unskilled admin work, and only got the job because she knew someone inside, you'd be lucky to get 12/hr in the private sector doing what she did. I don't find based on whats reported by media, government, and unions that either negotiate in good faith, the unions are just as bad. As for an employer coming in and imposing wages and such, welcome to the private sector, never worked in a job yet where employees had any say in their wages and benefits, the company says we pay this, you either take it or leave it, no room for negotiation.", "event_args": [{"start": 23, "end": 28, "trigger": "Strike", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 163, "end": 168, "trigger": "Strike", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 198, "end": 205, "trigger": "released", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 170, "end": 174, "mention": "Today", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 273, "end": 278, "trigger": "strike", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 263, "end": 270, "mention": "teachers", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 421, "end": 426, "trigger": "strike", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 405, "end": 412, "mention": "teachers", "role": "target"}]}, {"start": 793, "end": 795, "trigger": "pay", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 822, "end": 829, "mention": "teachers", "role": "recipient"}, {"start": 761, "end": 764, "mention": "B.C.", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 964, "end": 969, "trigger": "Strike", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 999, "end": 1006, "trigger": "released", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 971, "end": 975, "mention": "Today", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1079, "trigger": "strike", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1064, "end": 1071, "mention": "teachers", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1227, "trigger": "strike", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1206, "end": 1213, "mention": "teachers", "role": "target"}]}, {"start": 1594, "end": 1596, "trigger": "pay", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1623, "end": 1630, "mention": "teachers", "role": "recipient"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1565, "mention": "B.C.", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 2529, "end": 2540, "trigger": "negotiations", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2592, "end": 2593, "mention": "we", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2556, "trigger": "telling", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2592, "end": 2593, "mention": "we", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2829, "end": 2833, "trigger": "wages", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2808, "end": 2809, "mention": "we", "role": "giver"}, {"start": 2824, "end": 2827, "mention": "your", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 3206, "end": 3211, "trigger": "recoup", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3175, "end": 3176, "mention": "we", "role": "giver"}, {"start": 3090, "end": 3092, "mention": "you", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 3231, "end": 3238, "trigger": "charging", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3175, "end": 3176, "mention": "we", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 3637, "end": 3641, "trigger": "wages", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3730, "end": 3733, "trigger": "paid", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3721, "end": 3724, "mention": "they", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 3833, "end": 3836, "trigger": "made", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3947, "end": 3949, "trigger": "get", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3929, "end": 3931, "mention": "you", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 4176, "end": 4180, "trigger": "wages", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 4286, "end": 4290, "trigger": "wages", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4255, "end": 4263, "mention": "employees", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 4326, "end": 4328, "trigger": "pay", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4255, "end": 4263, "mention": "employees", "role": "entity"}]}]}

I doubt anyone here would have much direct experience. A quick look on Google turned up the following: Hello people, I am wondering what happens when somebody claims asylum at the US port of entry? It depends on where attempt is made and the person's citizenship/nationality. The person is almost always detained either for a threshold screening before an asylum officer or to appear directly before an immigration judge. There is generally no right to bail/bond for arriving aliens. It depends on where attempt is made and the person's citizenship/nationality. The person is almost always detained either for a threshold screening before an asylum officer or to appear directly before an immigration judge. There is generally no right to bail/bond for arriving aliens. Okay that's good information to know, thank you for your help. I doubt anyone here would have much direct experience. A quick look on Google turned up the following: Hey I read what was on that page, I'm still a little confused though... Would someone be detained in a detention facility then whilst waiting for their asylum to be granted or denied? There are a lot of variables such as claims at a border and the interior including affirmative claims and defensive claims. Would someone be detained in a detention facility then whilst waiting for their asylum to be granted or denied? Seems to vary, more likely if they are from a T Country. Would someone be detained in a detention facility then whilst waiting for their asylum to be granted or denied? It might depend on whether you're trying to enter the USA with or without inspection. My brother in law entered the USA without inspection and then claimed asylum. He was sent to a detention facility but bail was posted and we paid it. He's been out on bail now, with his asylum case pending since January 2007. He finally got \"the final\" hearing in May 2009. We got a different lawyer and filed an appeal, which is still pending. He has not yet had a first court date with the new case. It is not an easy or quick process, and is very expensive. Rene Not sure if this is still the case but at Heathrow they had signs up what to do if you were claiming Asylum. Hello people, I am wondering what happens when somebody claims asylum at the US port of entry? They are set up for a \"credible fear\" interview. There is a set procedure for it. If one has a quarter-decent claim, they will be enlarged into the United States and set up for further proceedings. Not sure if this is still the case but at Heathrow they had signs up what to do if you were claiming Asylum. I bet they did. I remember watching the documentary on border control at LHR. There was an African adult came in claiming to be a teenager and claiming ayslum due to having to commit murder or be killed himself. The UKBA officials doubted he was a teenager and surprisingly (not!) he'd lost all his papers so they had no way to find this out. The utter idiots at the UKBA then released him pending further police investigation. He went on the run and disappeared. UKBA and LHR appear to actively encourage people to cheat and abuse the asylum system. The utter idiots at the UKBA then released him pending further police investigation. He went on the run and disappeared. and pray what were they meant to do? With very limited detention space for immigration holds, there are strict guidelines about who can be detained. If the person didn't meet the guidelines the detention facilities will not take them. and pray what were they meant to do? Detain him until his age could be proven via a medical test. Instead they just let him go with the proviso he report to the police. And we wonder why the UK has been flooded with asylum seekers. Would someone be detained in a detention facility then whilst waiting for their asylum to be granted or denied? It's possible, yes. Will it happen to you? No one knows! Ian And we wonder why the UK has been flooded with asylum seekers. I don't. There were less than 20,000 in 2011, the latest year I can find figures for. That's about 1/3 of 1/10 of 1% of the population of the UK.

I still don't understand why he isn't under house arrest or doing social work? Am am total agreement with Patty. It's awful. Beyond belief. But it's real and it's Italy. Where there is no law. A few years ago when there was a real prospect of Berlusconi realising his ambition to be president I said to an Italian of my acquaintance that the prospect was horrific. \"Well good, it will get him out of our hair\" (teachers) I was told. Yes a throwaway comment maybe but I'm afraid that this jaundiced Italy watcher sees the place as just a load of factional interests.

{"doc_id": "ENG_DF_001503_20140317_G00A0GIYH", "document": "Bitcoins has anyone used them ? Has anyone on here used bitcoins ? I do not see much use for them unless you made purchases on the old Silk Road or now use Silk Road 2. It's one of those things that smells so strongly of Ponzi pyramid scheme I wish I had got some in the early days when they were cheap as chips. The mining now is almost impossible on a solo basis. I don't pretend to understand how they work for purchases but it seems they are more of a speculative commodity right now. Fewer and fewer exchanges can seem to swap them out for cash which seems to be a bit alarming. The exchanges themselves seem to be run by the strangest bunch too. Would you trust your cash to someone who trades collectable cards? There is absolutely no oversight or insurance. My friends nephew was one of the developers. he was a computer nerd in high school. Now he's a 26 years old multi millionaire. There are so many incompetent and/or shady characters running Bitcoin exchanges that it makes wall street bankers look like geniuses and angles. MtGox (once the world largest Bitcoin exchange) recently filed for bankruptcy after telling clients for months that they couldn't get their money because the bank only allowed a certain amount of ACH transfers daily and then later told clients they couldn't get their Bitcoins for some other reason. Finally they admitted that about 600,000 client Bitcoins and 100,000 MtGox Bitcoins were lost through theft (about $500 million or 7% of the outstanding Bitcoins). Other exchanges have also filed for bankruptcy due to stolen/lost Bitcoins and many well know Bitcoin players have been prosecuted for money laundering and other schemes. I don't understand what they are Her nephew left them over a year ago and has his own company now. He's far from shady. I don't understand what they are Bitcoins are virtual money that has no intrinsic value but is currently trading for about $630 each. Current USD Bitcoin Exchanges Initially someone created a software concept that would produce Bitcoins quickly but as time passed, it became more difficult to create them. After about 8 million Bitcoins were produced, even groups of people with computers couldn't produce Bitcoins without using more electricity than the current trading value of a Bitcoin and then companies produced special hardware that was designed for the sole purpose of producing Bitcoins. When 20 million Bitcoins are eventually produced, no more Bitcoins can be produced. Bitcoins are held in a blockchain and are validated by groups of miners (people that are producing Bitcoins). Therefore it needs Bitcoin miner software running around the world to validate trades. Although some stores take Bitcoins and instantly use an exchange to trade it into the local currency (customer usually doesn't know the exchange rate until it is exchanged), most of the trading is for speculation. Bitstamp is currently the largest USD exchange running out of the UK and LocalBitcoins is similar to an eBay concept of peer to peer trades. If you look at LocalBitcoins during the last 30 days, you will notice that Bitcoins traded as low as $5.76 and as high as $2,000. Most other exchanges have traded Bitcoins between $400-$700 during the past 30 days. Like eBay, you have to be very careful who you are dealing with on LocalBitcoins since they could take your money and not give you Bitcoins or visa/versa. Silk Road is referred to the illicit trading of Bitcoins usually for drug money laundering purposes. I don't understand what they are Michael's explanation is correct, but in short and simple terms, Bitcoins are pretend money. No central bank issued them, no country is \"standing behind\" Bitcoin. It is essentially a very complex confidence trick. So long as everyone who uses and holds Bitcoins acts as if they continue to believe that Bitcoins have value then everything will continue, but as soon as there is a whiff that \"the game is over\", they will sink to negligible value very very quickly. There isn't even a physical banknote or coin, so there isn't even collector value, the currency exists only in the on-line world. Her nephew left them over a year ago and has his own company now. He's far from shady. Says you! Have you done much due diligence into your friend's nephew? The only difference between bitcoins and tulip bulbs is that when all the fuss dies down, with a tulip bulb you can still grow a pretty flower.", "event_args": [{"start": 114, "end": 122, "trigger":

Her ex-spouse Charles Saatchi was almost certainly a bully and her self-esteem must have been in the gutter. I imagine that she just wanted to have some kind of brief respite and stupidly took cocaine again. It is odd that other 'celebs' have openly admitted or been photographed taking drugs, yet they have no problem entering the US: eg. Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, Keith Richards (and probably other members of the 'Stones') Kate Moss and even ex-heroin addict Russell Brand.... Paul McCartney was even detained in a cell in Japan for having drugs (marijuana) but he seems to be very welcome in the States. I reckon that Nigella will be back in the States soon, isn't the 'O' visa for members of the sports &amp; entertainment industry?", "event_args": [{"start": 25, "end": 32, "trigger": "entering", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "mention": "Nigella", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 63, "end": 72, "trigger": "commenting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 52, "end": 52, "mention": "I", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 258, "end": 263, "trigger": "travel", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 251, "end": 253, "mention": "her", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 291, "end": 300, "trigger": "commenting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 280, "end": 280, "mention": "I", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 486, "end": 491, "trigger": "travel", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 479, "end": 481, "mention": "her", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 781, "end": 790, "trigger": "commenting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 770, "end": 770, "mention": "I", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 976, "end": 981, "trigger": "travel", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 969, "end": 971, "mention": "her", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1057, "trigger": "travel", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1066, "end": 1067, "mention": "US", "role": "destination"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1047, "mention": "her", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1239, "trigger": "reporting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1223, "end": 1226, "mention": "They", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1269, "trigger": "travel", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1246, "end": 1248, "mention": "she", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1575, "trigger": "entering", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1581, "end": 1582, "mention": "US", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1634, "trigger": "get", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1581, "end": 1582, "mention": "US", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1761, "trigger": "entering", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1767, "end": 1768, "mention": "US", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1820, "trigger": "get", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1767, "end": 1768, "mention": "US", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2339, "trigger": "late", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2915, "end": 2922, "trigger": "entering", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2894, "end": 2897, "mention": "they", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2928, "end": 2929, "mention": "US", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 3101, "end": 3108, "trigger": "detained", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3123, "end": 3127, "mention": "Japan", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 3115, "end": 3118, "trigger": "cell", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3235, "end": 3238, "trigger": "back", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3247, "end": 3252, "mention": "States", "role": "destination"}, {"start": 3219, "end": 3225, "mention": "Nigella", "role": "person"}]}]}

My wife and i have just bought a property on the central algarve as a holiday home and planned retirement home. We have spent the last 14 years in Dubai and decided its time to start the retirement planning and the algarve won hands down. We have already been over earlier this month for 2 weeks and ordered the furniture etc and generally found everything (except petrol!) cheaper than Dubai, so my 2 questions for the forum are: How much should we budget to spend per month for when we retire to the algarve? For a reasonably decent existence and lifestyle? We can ship our cars to Portugal relatively cheaply, but i hear its extremely expensive to import them into portugal? any ideas Many thanks See this thread: Could I live on 1000 euros a month Cars coming from Dubai could be complicated, you \"may\" be able to import them and avoid the \"imposto automovel\" tax(can be done with cars that came within EU and Switzerland) Certicate of conformity could also be a problem.

Thats what i thought, thanks very much for the quick reply I wrote a big article about this, I hope the admins won't mind me posting it as I think it will help you. I just scanned through it and it's all still valid, but I would say our gas and water costs have crept up in the last year (water is now hitting €50 / month and it's not like we're using more). I agree with Ged about the cars - just buy here and avoid the heartache!

I agree with Ged about the cars - just buy here and avoid the heartache! That's very useful much appreciated Hi allylulu, Just thought I drop a note here because you two appear to be in a similar situation as my wife and I. We have lived in DXB for the past ten years and have decided 'enough is enough' and plan to retire to Portugal – target May 2015, although we are heading to the Silver Coast. As for cost of living you may find this site useful. Not sure if you have explored the tax benefits of applying for the Non Habitual Resident scheme, maybe worth getting in contact with a good tax advisor over there. We used PWC. Initially we were apprehensive about taking our car across, but after finding out that the same model we have here will cost a staggering 15K Euros more in Portugal, we did some further research and made some inquiries. The result is there are companies and people who will handle all of the paperwork for your, for a price, (but not 15K Euros). Non-European cars will not have a Certificate of Conformity, but you can get the car certified by companies like: T.D.S. - Engenharia e Gestão Automóvel, Lda. There are many examples of people importing cars from Canada and US, which do not have CoC. Anyhow, I thought it would be worth sharing experiences with you.

You can run with the best intentions and if you don't give what the voters want in their opinion then you have failed. How many think when the gun registry was introduced that it was a good idea. How many elected officials voted in favour of it when clearly their constituents wanted them to vote against it. I'm voting Green for the first time in my life.

With the religious right in control of the republican party, I suspected much greater resistance with rioting in the streets but opposition has been more like a whimper than a bang. However in liberal France, riots have occurred putting fear into the government about making gay marriage legal. In France I guess it's ok to have a mistress but not ok to be gay. Is it possible the right have quietly decided to give up on the defence of marriage and anti-gay issues? Maybe the Republicans eying up $$$ they are losing from potential gay &amp; lesbian donors? Is it possible the right have quietly decided to give up on the defence of marriage and anti-gay issues? Maybe the Republicans eying up $$$ they are losing from potential gay &amp; lesbian donors? It's against their character. They are still fighting Obamacare as the work of the devil and there are a lot more votes they could pick up from the center and left if they supported Obamacare. Actually I am very surprised that the decisions have been overturned quickly without much of a struggle from the right. With the religious right in control of the republican party, I suspected much greater resistance with rioting in the streets but opposition has been more like a whimper than a bang. I don't know. In a couple of places at least the judge has been very strict on who has standing to defend the laws much to the dismay of organizations like NOM. It comes down to Governors wary of a tide against them in an election year plus noting the SCOTUS ruling against DOMA, how can they in all conscience defend it. However in liberal France, riots have occurred putting fear into the government about making gay marriage legal. In France I guess it's ok to have a mistress but not ok to be gay. It's not that \"likely to cause a riot in France\" is a particularly high bar though. We were on holiday in Avignon when Sarko was elected President and the next morning the breakfast news very matter-of-factly reported the \"manifestations anti-Sarkozy\" that had broken out across the country the night before when the results came in. However in liberal France, riots have occurred putting fear into the government about making gay marriage legal. In France I guess it's ok to have a mistress but not ok to be gay. This doesn't surprise me. \"Liberal France\" is Roman Catholic. So yes, a mistress is fine, being gay is not... yet. Explain something to me - how can a Federal judge overturn a state ban? Or have I been reading shoddy reporting? Explain something to me - how can a Federal judge overturn a state ban? Or have I been reading shoddy reporting? The federal courts are empowered to rule on anything pertaining to the US constitution. There is a system in place for rulings and appeals until the issue is brought before the supreme court. If the supreme court elects to hear the case, then their ruling will be final. If they don't elect to hear the case, the last ruling is final. Since DOMA was struck down by the supreme court, many of the state bans may be in conflict with DOMA. Therefore when someone appeals to a federal judge, that judge's ruling (in his/her opinion) is just a reflection of the ruling made by the supreme court. However the attorney general of the state can appeal that decision but often the decision is left in place before it gets to the supreme court and the supreme court refuses to hear that appeal. Explain something to me - how can a Federal judge overturn a state ban? Or have I been reading shoddy reporting? The courts have the authority to rule on the constitutionality of any legislation and are invoking the 14th Amendment, equal protection under the law. They can appeal but they're not, probably because it's an election year and they figure it's a losing issue.", "event_args": [{"start": 484, "end": 490, "trigger": "rioting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 591, "end": 595, "trigger": "riots", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 933, "end": 938, "trigger": "donors", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 884, "end": 887, "mention": "they", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 1130, "end": 1135, "trigger": "donors", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1081, "end": 1084, "mention": "they", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1559, "trigger": "rioting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1855, "end": 1862, "trigger": "election", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1844, "end": 1847, "mention": "them", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1982, "end": 1986, "trigger": "riots", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2171, "trigger": "riot", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2176, "end": 2181, "mention": "France", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2230, "end": 2236, "trigger": "holiday", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2219, "end": 2220, "mention": "We", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2241, "end": 2247, "mention": "Avignon", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 2264, "end": 2270, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2254, "end": 2258, "mention": "Sarko", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2272, "end": 2280, "mention": "President", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 2344, "end": 2351, "trigger": "reported", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2254, "end": 2258, "mention": "Sarko", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2272, "end": 2280, "mention": "President", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 2358, "end": 2371, "trigger": "manifestations", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2496, "end": 2500, "trigger": "riots", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 4097, "end": 4104, "trigger": "election", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}]}
{"doc_id": "ENG_DF_001503_20140520_G00A0GK65", "document": "Self pack container - Bristol to Sydney Long time reader, first time writer! My partner and I are emigrating to Australia from the UK. We've lived in Sydney for a year, and have travelled around the country in a motorhome. We are very much looking forward to making the most of our 175 visas! I am looking to self pack a container, and ship our personal effects to Sydney, from Bristol. Reasons are cost and trust in handling our effects. In short, from my research, I can see there are several things we need to do. My reason for posting is to ensure that I have everything covered and to share my research. If I have missed anything, please let me know! Questions in RED Shipping Plan Bristol, UK to Sydney, Australia 20ft self-pack container Overview Arrange Shipping Agent - container delivery and shipping Arrange Marine Insurance - to cover loss during shipping Arrange Clearing Agent - assistance with AQIS and import into Sydney Arrange Delivery Company - collection from Sydney and delivery to new home Details Container Delivery I am to check that the container provided by the shipping company is free of smells and leaks (closing all doors and looking for sunlight / holes). I have read even the smallest leaks can create water problems. Any bad smells are likely to transfer over to our belongings. The reasons for a sole-use 20ft container are: I want to pack it myself I don't want to share with someone and increase the chances of mix-ups, loss or damage from excessive handling As soon as the container is packed I want it shipped, I don't want to wait I can easily fill a 20ft container, so any cost savings on sharing will be minimal Loading Container / Inventory / Bristol Port I intend to have a 20ft container delivered to a storage facility, where our effects are already packed into boxes. I estimate around 2-3 hours to load everything on properly. I am to ensure that heavy items are at the back, lighter towards the front. Ratchet straps may be required to ensure that items are really secure in the container. I may consider getting hold of some tarp to cover the boxes and furniture. The boxes/items will be clearly labelled with permanent marker pen (e.g. Box 1) and this labelling will marry up with a full inventory of contents. Items that the AQIS may be interested in will be packed in seperate boxes and labelled accordingly on the inventory. \"Fragile\", \"Heavy\" and \"Do not open with knives\" labels as appropriate. A sample of this inventory would look like: BOX | CONTENTS | VALUE | AQIS RISK? Box 1 | DVDs and CDs - approx 50 | $100 AUD | No Risk Box 1 | Books | $20 AUD | No Risk Box 2 | Wicker Basket | $10 AUD | Risk Box 3 | Bicycle | $200 AUD | Risk - cleaned I will value the effects, but probably only include the value column for the import declaration value and marine insurance. Do I need monetary values on the inventory? The container will be collected by the Shipping Agent - most likely the container will remain on the back of the lorry during delivery and packing and be taken away the same day. The Shipping Agent will be given the required documents and the container will be sealed and taken to port. Shipping Shipping can take around 2 months, so if I want items in Australia by October 1st, I ought to have them on a container ship by August 1st. I will take out marine insurance to cover total loss. I will see if I can get insurance for the expensive singular items (guitars, audio/visual equipment). I've got recommendations for Letton Percival - any others? How long did your container take to arrive? Arrival into Sydney On arrival all of our effects are unloaded from the container into an AQIS storage facility and checked over by the AQIS. Having an inventory that flags items of interest should greatly help with speeding this process up and reduce the amount of handling and complications. I have heard that this can take up to 3 weeks. Any ideas / experiences / costs? The Clearing Agent in Sydney will liase with AQIS to ensure any appropriate charges are paid and arrange the forward delivery from the AQIS holding facility. Potentially I may need to have my effects stored somewhere in Sydney while I find some accomodation - can a Clearing Agent help with this? Delivery to new home The Delivery Agent will collect the effects from storage (or potentially straight from AQIS storage) and deliver to our new home.

Husband got up in the morning before me, as usual, then came into the bedroom holding his phone to his ear and says \"Have I done anything in the past year that would cause me to have a police record?\" \"Uh... no...?\" Then he walked out of the room telling off whoever was on the phone. So I started to get up, and the woman who owned the house we were staying in comes in with all these forms, which I recognised as a bunch of IMM forms for immigration. She then says \"So we don't have Husband's police check.\" \"Uh, yes you do, it came back 'no trace', we applied back in 2012, and everything was fine. You've already issued him PR. \"No, it doesn't work that way. We need a new police certificate. \"What? No, you already gave him PR. He has his card and everything. He's picked up everything and is living and working in Canada. \"That doesn't matter, he needs a police check, or he'll have his PR revoked.\" This exchange went back and forth for awhile with me arguing immigration rules with her, and then: Her: \"Let's start over, I don't even know your name. My name is Erica. Me: \"Wait, you don't even know who I am and you're telling me that you're going to revoke my husband's immigration status?\" \"Only if that woman doesn't win the election. If she loses then all immigrants will have to leave the country. \"... Election? You mean if Kathleen Wynne doesn't win then Husband has to leave? \"Yes.\" And then I woke up. [For those not in Ontario, there's a provincial election next week, quite hotly contested at the moment. Not sure who will win it. Wynne is the current leader who is fighting to remain in power.] So yeah, that was my twisted and very strange dream about immigration. It was only a matter of time. First, Moderator. Next, lunacy. Haha! Brilliant! Love that you managed to stay logical even in dream land First, Moderator. Next, lunacy. Other way around. You only get asked to be a Moderator or Concierge if you are in the full throes of lunacy. Otherwise Sue knows there's no way you'd say yes. Haha! Brilliant! Love that you managed to stay logical even in dream land Haha pretty much! When I told my husband about this dream, he just went \"...You spend way too much time on BE.\" And walked away. Hahahaha. It was only a matter of time. First, Moderator. Next, lunacy. Other way around. You only get asked to be a Moderator or Concierge if you are in the full throes of lunacy. Otherwise Sue knows there's no way you'd say yes. So as a super mod, that makes you.... ready to be committed? :P Something about 'fool me once'...?? So as a super mod, that makes you.... ready to be committed? :P Something about 'fool me once'...?? I've no idea, but just as soon as these lovely men in white coats let me out of my padded cell, I'm sure I'll figure it out. @SchnookoLoly Ha. I thought that was going to be a \"bureaucracy\" dream until you got to the election part and I was going to ask if you had been a civil servant. It reminded me of a recurring dream I used to have where someone in the education dept discovered I left school too early and even though I was an adult and been employed for many years - the last time I had this dream I was about 40 - I had to return to school to complete the last few months. Having been a 30 year civil servant I put it down to bureaucratic nonsense. So I thought you were going on similar lines because of something missed. Except in CIC's case it may well be the sort of thing they'd do, if my past experience with them is anything to go by. I've no idea, but just as soon as these lovely men in white coats let me out of my padded cell, I'm sure I'll figure it out.

He'll be willing to take out many more before they finally shoot him, or he blows his own brains out Depending on what his plan is (how far ahead he's thought it out) he may have slipped the cordon and got away, already commited suicide, or could be holed up in a prepared defensive position ready to do battle. At least now the sun's up the law should have airborne drones with cameras as well as IR imaging searching the forest. A witness said he has 2 assault rifles, a crossbow and a knife. I'm guessing when he is located police will assume he could have explosives as well and approach accordingly.

Do you think he's left any traps? He must be very good. Usually, when a convenience store is robbed the villain is tracked down within a couple of hours. Last month someone tried to rob a bank customer trying to make a deposit. A bystander relieved them of the money they had taken and they made a getaway by car. They were caught within an hour.

Not yet, though he's been spotted 3 times this morning by members of the public. Actually, it was said on the news that \"if guns were?

If guns weren't freely available, those cops wouldn't have been shot in the first place. It's not my argument I was just saying.

Those stroppy teachers with their inflated sense of how much they are worth striking meant that I could drive through the school zones at a proper speed today; none of this 30kph bollocks. I hope it lasts forever. Are they striking for a sufficiently long period that they will extend their summer vacation? Are they striking for a sufficiently long period that they will extend their summer vacation? They seem to do it this time every year. One of my neighbours told me that the union spent all the cash and there isn't any strike pay. Dunno if that's true though. Personally I think it is a small price to pay to save me a minute or so every other day as the local filth quite often have radar near the schools I drive past. They seem to do it this time every year. One of my neighbours told me that the union spent all the cash and there isn't any strike pay. Dunno if that's true though. Personally I think it is a small price to pay to save me a minute or so every other day as the local filth quite often have radar near the schools I drive past. The schools that my kids go to always seem to arrange \"trips\" at this time of year. Anything to avoid having to teach. Both sides play dirty games, I can't say I support either side. I don't have kids, so I am not affected directly, but it just seems to be non-stop fights with this union. Seems the government saves X amount every day they don't work, and some say that is why the government is in no hurry to settle, but I don't know how accurate these reports are. Maybe teachers should work for individual districts directly, with each district negotiating the contract, and not one contract for all as it appears it is in BC. Then at-least the entire province would not be on strike at once. We have a few teachers who are friends who are totally hacked off with the whole thing. What started off as a \"moral\" crusade (with a bit of a payrise on the side (??!??)) seems to have become hijacked by the Unions. Apparently the teachers didn't realise there wasn't a strike fund kitty left. They thought they'd still get some money. They're also acutely aware their popularity amongst parents now scrambling for childcare - or shelling out $80 a day for 2 in daycare - has diminished dramatically. As a parent with a couple of kids in the system, when someone else's fight directly affects my pocket, my sympathies begin to stretch rather thin (not that I support Union fuelled disputes in general anyway). Another friend told me at the weekend that the starting pay for a \"normal\" teacher was in the mid $40k's - rising to $85 (very ish) K for the top grade of a \"normal\" teacher. But in the Province as a whole the average salary of a teacher is around $78k, so most teachers have been in post so long they almost all get top whack already. Just saying - and I don't know the veracity of this information..... Both sides play dirty games, I can't say I support either side.

Then at-least the entire province would not be on strike at once. Or, return the appropriate amount to taxpayers via a reduction in income/property taxes, and then let the taxpayers negotiate directly with the teachers. Yeah, that'd work I reckon they are so whiny cos most teachers are married to other teachers so they end up suffering from groupthink like the nazis in Germany. What bunch of greedy self-absorbed bastards. Really putting children first. Or, return the appropriate amount to taxpayers via a reduction in income/property taxes, and then let the taxpayers negotiate directly with the teachers.

Grocery stores in California did that about 10 years ago, they let the strike drag on for months, used management to run the stores, customers kept coming, and after about 4 months or so without pay, the employees settled, and really got nothing in return. Northwest Airlines played hard ball with their mechanics who went on strike, those workers never got their job back, after 2 years or so the union called off the strike when it was clear the airline was never going to settle. i know right? There's a fancy yoga place near me that's giving the poor souls a free month of yoga! Yoga will allow then to stretch after all that standing and placard holding! Summer schools should apply for LMO's for teachers. shouldn't be too hard to prove there are no Canadians willing to take the job Yoga will allow then to stretch after all that standing and placard holding!

Not sure going back to the UK is brilliant idea but I understand the sentiment.

I'm too settled here to think about leaving. My wife wouldn't want to leave the US anyway since she was born here. California is a strongly Democrat State and Trump's policies wouldn't interfere much with the internal running of this State. The main thing to remember also is that he's got 4 years. no more. If he nominates Palin for his VP he wont even get that Why would you leave? If certain things changes, then maybe that would be a time to think about it, but an election may change who is in power, but can they do anything with that power, whether via the system or the inclination.

If Trump did win, I'd venture he will calm down and realize he won't have the powers he thinks he will to willy nilly change things. Candidates always seem to talk big, then realize once they win, how much they actually cannot do. It really depends what happens to Congress. Without the support of both the House and Senate it is difficult for the President to do much, with the support of neither the task becomes much harder. This has been the pattern for most of the past 23 years - Bill Clinton faced a hostile congress for much of his presidency, George W Bush was out of step with his own party and achieved relatively little, and since the Tea Party revolution in 2010 President Obama hasn't been able to do much either - his landmark achievement of the Affordable Care Act is pretty much his only memorable achievement.

Few days later it arrived in Lisbon. And there it sat for nearly a month. then I get a registered letter asking for fiscal number and original invoice. Send that off and wait again. After paying for their services and duty and vat, I wonder why I bothered. Next time I will send things to friends in the EU and even with the extra postage I will get it cheaper and a lot quicker. If it's going from one individual to another I believe it can be marked as a gift and below a set value (not sure what) it then becomes tax free however, other than that, they're entitled to charge you import tax AND 23% IVA/VAT on cost of item + cost of post + cost of packaging. I've sometimes had to pay more in duty than cost of item when shipping car spares from the USA. If it's an expensive item it might be worth considering looking at VAT rates for different items to different EU countries. For example, some items are rated at 23% in Portugal but only about 5% in Denmark and it might be cheaper to ship to Denmark and then road transport/courier from there to PT and the additional VAT/IVA might not be chargeable. Supposedly, items under 20 euros are let through without formalities. I often order small items from China, since they're just ridiculously cheap. Mostly tools that are unavailable locally. Recently I ordered a thickness meter for 35 Euros, even though I know it will take a long time and likely cost 20 in taxes. The cheapest one I could get in Europe is 150 euros. You could trans-ship through another EU country, but then you're asking someone to receive it, re-address it, and take it to the post office for you. How much of your friend / relative's time did that take and what was that time worth? Also, you never know if the first country will charge duty and VAT just like Portugal, as they can / should.

At least you received yours In 2014 I had same problem, sent in the required doc's,waited several weeks, then contacted them yet again,only to be informed the \"goods\" had been returned to the supplier, left it a couple off weeks,contacted the supplier only to be told the goods had never arrived !! I can only assume that they went \"missing\" inside the system Once I asked my 'friend' in US order something for me, to avoid the custom charge and expensive postage, I still haven't received it, after more than 1 year and she has left US. It's not big thing but I will never do it again unless the person who's doing it is someone really close to you.

Nothing in BLM says that other lives don't matter too. From Wikipedia. \"United States President Barack Obama spoke to the debate between Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter. [138] Obama said, \"I think that the reason that the organizers used the phrase Black Lives Matter was not because they were suggesting that no one else's lives matter... rather what they were suggesting was there is a specific problem that is happening in the African American community that's not happening in other communities.\" He also said \"that is a legitimate issue that we've got to address.\" It's not \"Only Black Lives Matter\", rather \"Black Lives Matter Too\". It's not \"Only Black Lives Matter\", rather \"Black Lives Matter Too\". The hash tag #BLMTO u mean? The TO means Toronto I do agree tho that Black Lives Matter Too would be a better slogan. It's not \"Only Black Lives Matter\", rather \"Black Lives Matter Too\". This. I do agree tho that Black Lives Matter Too would be a better slogan. If you think about the campaign in a positive manner rather assuming the worst about people then the \"too\" is implicit. (btw, there's no such thing as reverse racism. It's just racism) So I was watching a protest just now on CBC were Wynne was stood amonst \"Black Lives Matter\" protesters. Can anyone explain why only black lives matter? Is this not like reverse racism? Sammy Yatim wasn't black what about his life? I know it's about police v minority's but black people are not the only ones, what about the rest of the comunity!! Should it not be a \"civilian lives matter demonstration\" ? Its because in the US black lives don’t matter and have never mattered. They've been and continue to be, a brutalized, subjugated and tortured people. Historically white lives have mattered whereas black ones haven't. To even suggest that the two (white and black lives in the US) are comparable shows at best a scant understanding of the reality... Lets make sure we keep it civilised peeps... Lets make sure we keep it civilised peeps... Fair enough. I'm not racist some of my best friends are white. Its because in the US black lives don’t matter and have never mattered. They've been and continue to be, a brutalized, subjugated and tortured people. Historically white lives have mattered whereas black ones haven't. To even suggest that the two (white and black lives in the US) are comparable shows at best a scant understanding of the reality... This actually makes sense, I presumed it's more a response to the US division regarding black and white folks. So why did Wynne came out and agree that Toronto had issues. Is it getting that bad here too? Surely the problem is that visual and identifiable minorities do matter tremendously as they serve a central role as the ones we wish to vilify and blame for our socio economic woes. I've never spent much time in the warmer near Mexico bits of the States, but I believe the Mexicans are very poorly regarded there and not just by Trump. I don't like the term 'Black lives Matter' either. 'People Matter' might be adopted in North America gererally, but they don't....'normal' black, white, indigenous men and particularly women are poorly regarded individually unless they have money, or are loud and energetic enough to defend themselves. It's a shame there isn't a magic wand that could homogenize the lot of us, one sex only, and then we'd be bound to get along, wouldn't we North American policing in general seems appalling, but I suppose we only hear the bad bits, I really hope there might be good bits too?", "event_args": [{"start": 39, "end": 45, "trigger": "protest", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 68, "end": 72, "mention": "Wynne", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 112, "end": 121, "trigger": "protesters", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 68, "end": 72, "mention": "Wynne", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 409, "end": 421, "trigger": "demonstration", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 535, "end": 539, "trigger": "spoke", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1609, "end": 1615, "trigger": "protest", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1638, "end": 1642, "mention": "Wynne", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1691, "trigger": "protesters", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1638, "end": 1642, "mention": "Wynne", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1991, "trigger": "demonstration", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2112, "trigger": "brutalized", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2121, "end": 2124, "trigger": "ated", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2137, "trigger": "tortured", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2606, "end": 2615, "trigger": "brutalized", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2624, "end": 2627, "trigger": "ated", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2633, "end": 2640, "trigger": "tortured", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}]}

If this challenge is accepted by the court in UK the date for the referendum cannot be met.

I haven't heard anything about the consequences of this ruling...and how UK, after exiting EU, will deal with perhaps millions of EU expats returning and demanding their pension rights if they are treated similarly to non-EU expats. If UK exits EU it is likely the pound will devalue significantly. and so will the value of pensions paid in sterling but usually converted to expats residency currencies...this will significantly impact expats but I haven't heard any debate on this either. Any comments? Doesn't sound like anyone's too worried about it :-) We're not receiving a pension from the UK so no thoughts on that. We have sometimes considered that when we're ready to settle down, we might want to go to South of France or Greece. Should UK leave the EU this will no longer be so easy Anyway, I refuse to believe that that it will come to this There's s big discussion going on here, Davita. Join it at you peril! Leaving the EU Thanks Fenella...I agree the Brits (at least the media) seem more concerned that Obama has the audacity to mention the issue than deal with the issue. Boris Johnson knows how to stir the ploretariat...much like Stalin and Hitler. Trump applies the same type nationalism rhetoric in the USA Primaries. Anyone notice that Donald and Boris are look-alikes! Strangely, Boris was born in Manhatten as was Donald. If Trump becomes President he has vowed USA will become Great America. If Johnson leads UK to Brexit, and the consequent dissolution when Scotland leaves, there will be no Great Britain... If I were a UK expat living a retired life in EU I'd be very worried...in fact, I'd consider returning and claiming all benefits like NHS and welfare etc. If millions of expats did that...the UK economy would bankrupt... There's s big discussion going on here, Davita. Join it at you peril! Leaving the EU See my post a couple of days ago....on the German forum as many UK expats live there...the Take-it-Outside forum isn't my type of debate. Deathly silence is the response so far but, even here in Bali, I can hear the sucking of false teeth as my question is germinating thought... I do still believe that Boris is the lesser of two evils:-) The problem is the whole the whole \"Great\" in \"Great Britain\". Too many Brits still believe this is the case and that's why they'll be much better off out of the EU. The days of the great British Empire are long gone but not everyone sees it. If Johnson leads UK to Brexit, and the consequent dissolution when Scotland leaves, there will be no Great Britain... Although I don't follow things closely anymore I can't understand why Scotland will ever again even think about leaving the UK. Shirley after the plunge in oil prices Scotland's economy would have nose dived to zilch if the Scots had voted to leave the UK last time. They would then have had to get out the begging bowl to Westminster. Although I don't follow things closely anymore I can't understand why Scotland will ever again even think about leaving the UK. I suggest searching anything about Scotland leaving UK, if UK leaves EU, and you'll find lots of news on that subject....mainly to the effect United Kingdom would collapse.", "event_args": [{"start": 660, "end": 666, "trigger": "Pension", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 700, "end": 707, "trigger": "pensions", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 685, "end": 686, "mention": "EU", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 960, "end": 968, "trigger": "returning", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 990, "end": 996, "trigger": "pension", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1151, "trigger": "pensions", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1156, "trigger": "paid", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1395, "trigger": "receiving", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1416, "end": 1417, "mention": "UK", "role": "giver"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1378, "mention": "We", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1405, "trigger": "pension", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1377, "end": 1378, "mention": "We", "role": "recipient"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1417, "mention": "UK", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1528, "trigger": "go", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1482, "end": 1483, "mention": "we", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2175, "end": 2181, "trigger": "becomes", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2183, "end": 2191, "mention": "President", "role": "position"}, {"start": 2169, "end": 2173, "mention": "Trump", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2385, "end": 2391, "trigger": "retired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2355, "end": 2355, "mention": "I", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2367, "end": 2368, "mention": "UK", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2456, "trigger": "returning", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2355, "end": 2355, "mention": "I", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2401, "end": 2402, "mention": "EU", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 2668, "end": 2671, "trigger": "post", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2665, "end": 2666, "mention": "my", "role": "entity"}]}]}

The Delhi Police filed the charges at the Saket court in south Delhi where the shocking gang rape took place on Dec. 16 on a moving bus when the six thugs raped and tortured a 23-year-old medical student for more than half an hour before throwing the dying victim and her boyfriend onto a remote road naked. Police said the accused also tried to run over the two victims but the boy pulled the woman aside inches from the bus. The victim died at a Singapore hospital last Saturday after suffering from multi- organic failures caused by fatal body and brain damages inflicted by the assaulters, all of whom hailed from a stinking slum in south Delhi. The accused were charged with murder, gang rape, unnatural assault, kidnapping, destruction of evidence and a number other offenses, which are considered serious enough for capital punishment by hanging. The Indian capital has been dipped into a deep melancholy after days of furious protests against the brutality. The sixth of the accused, a juvenile, will be charged at a juvenile court in accordance with the law, said police sources. While anger of Indians remain unabated over the horrifying case, authorities have promised to guarantee justice for both the victim and the accused in dealing with the case. However, if the accused were given any leniency, the public's anger would again break out in the streets as was seen over the past two weeks when the Indian capital experienced unprecedented protests by students and other citizens at the center of power of the country. A fast track court has been set up at Saket court by the country's chief justice and the case will be delivered by this weekend to the fast track court. PRA  Meanwhile, the Indian government and the opposition are all posed to debate on a new anti-rape law to make harsher and more efficient punishment for rapists and women molesters. A government minister has called for the naming of the proposed new law after the victim of the Delhi gang rape. However, some Congress leaders have expressed opposition to the proposal by Minister of State of Human Resources Shashi Tharoor, considered one of the country's most outspoken government ministers. The gang rape has deeply shaken India and led to a national soul searching on how to better protest women against rapes and other violence, which are reported on a daily basis in the country.

{"doc_id": "ENG_NW_001278_20130109_F00012KKG", "document": "Guns for guns, dilemma for gun control in U.S. Guns for guns, dilemma for gun control in U.S. LOS ANGELES, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- The horrific Connecticut elementary school shooting has reignited the debate over gun control in the United States but at the same time gun sales have increased dramatically in the country. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recorded gun sales in December 2012 with more than 2.7 million background checks being conducted through its National Instant Check System (NICS). In December, 2,783,765 total background checks were carried out to purchase firearms, surpassing the previous record from November 2012 when 2,006,919 checks were performed, officials said. About 19.6 million background checks were carried out for firearm purchases in 2012, a 19-percent rise from 2011 and more than in any year since 1998, according to the FBI. Each check doesn't represent a single gun, just a single background check transaction. Since the NICS system was established in November 1998, a total of 160,474,702 background checks were made. Of these, only around 0.006 percent of those attempted purchases were denied and 0.00008 percent (fewer than a hundred people a year) were prosecuted for lying on the form. Analysts attributed the spike in sales late last year to concerns over possible new gun control regulations following the presidential election in November and the Connecticut school shooting in mid-December. There now are millions more guns in California, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, than there were 10 years ago. The California attorney general's office said gun dealers sold 600,000 guns in the state in 2011, up from 350,000 in 2002. The decade long surge in gun sales was driven partially by a widespread fear of more gun controls, some analysts said. The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research said that 10 years ago, roughly 5 million Californians, or 20 percent of the state's adults, had at least one gun in their home. Since then, California gun dealers have sold another 4 million guns. The uptick in sales started in 2004, but exploded around 2008, when Barack Obama was elected president. \"When the president or senators threaten to take people's gun rights away, that's when we see things really pick up,\" said Bryan Schaff, owner of Hoffmeyer's Firearms &amp; Sporting Goods in Grass Valley. The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14, obviously became another reason for more people to buy guns. There is no immediate statistics available on how many guns were sold after the shooting, but Dan Hendrix, a gun owner in California, said that after the school attack there was nothing left on the market at all. Gun supporters hold that people, not guns, are to blame for the shootings. Some researchers say that more important than the increase in gun sales is who is buying guns. Young men are the most likely demographic group to be injured or killed with a gun, state health records show. Despite the debate, California goes ahead with some new gun laws for 2013. The long gun open carry ban law prohibits the open carrying of unloaded long guns, such as rifles and shotguns, in public places. There is no deny that firearms industry in the U.S. is thriving despite the debate over gun control, and it seems that the \"guns for guns\" attitude has been shared by many Americans, thus making gun control more difficult in the country. The firearms industry's total economic impact on the United States in 2012 is estimated at 31.8 billion dollars, according to the U.S. National Shooting Sports Foundation. While that's less than 1 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, it's about what Americans spend on the arts in a year. Altogether, gun makers manufactured about 5.5 million firearms in the U.S. in 2010, a drop of less than 1 percent over 2009, according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Of that 2010 production, some 242,000 firearms were exported, while an additional 3.25 million were imported from other countries. According to the National Institute of Justice, as of 2009, Americans owned an estimated 310 million firearms, roughly one for every person in the country. That represents a doubling of the number of guns owned per capita since 1968. America's domestic arsenal includes some 114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 82 million shotguns.

The victim was on way to her village on the bus when the driver and conductor abducted her and took her to an undisclosed location where they and their five accomplices took turns to rape her before dumping her near her village,\" the official said, on condition of anonymity. Six of the seven accused have been arrested and a manhunt has been launched to track down the seventh accused who is on the run since the incident came to light, he said. The latest case came barely a month after the Delhi University student was gangraped by six men on a moving bus in the national capital. She and her boyfriend, who had boarded the bus after watching a movie at a multiplex, were also beaten up mercilessly before being thrown off the vehicle. Earlier this month, the 23-year-old student succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in Singapore, where she was flown in after her condition worsened at a government hospital in the Indian capital. All the accused are currently in judicial custody facing rape and murder charges which carry a maximum punishment of death penalty.

According to organizers of the so-called \"Demo for All\" event, which opposes the government's \"marriage for all\" bill, about 500,000 participants will take part in the massive demonstrations. Five high-speed trains, 900 buses and hundreds of cars were provided to help protesters join the capital marches. But police put the number of participants at about 120,000. In Paris, thousands of people headed by politicians from the conservative right-wing parties walked in a festive atmosphere towards the Eiffel Tower, where floods of protestors will finally converge late in the afternoon \"to defend the concept of family, father, mother, child.\" \"We love homosexuals but a child must be born from a man and a woman, and the law must respect that. We would like all the country to take up this subject because it is not just about our privacy, it concerns especially the future generations,\" Frigide Barjot, a Catholic artist and a protest organizer, told the news channel BFMTV. The Socialist government approved the bill to allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children in November 2012. During his election campaign, President Francois Hollande promised the legislation would be endorsed by mid-2013. Polls have showed that a majority of French voters back gay marriage, but are split on the issue of adoption. The draft law will be presented to parliament at the end of January. Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden currently allow gay couples to marry and adopt children.

{"doc_id": "ENG_NW_001278_20130117_F00012AFP", "document": "China Focus: Government economy drive cools holiday hospitality sector China Focus: Government economy drive cools holiday hospitality sector HEFEI, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Young couple Zhang Ben and Wu Luanluan were surprised at being able to hold their wedding banquet in a hotel that simultaneously hosted two political sessions on the same day. The openings of the local people's congress and people's political consultative conference would normally have been grand affairs taking over the whole of a venue like the one Zhang and Ben used in Fuyang City in central China's Anhui Province earlier this month. However, with much-publicized central government orders for officials to reject extravagance, the usual conference hospitality was simplified into a buffet and the dining hall was saved for the wedding. Deputies and CPPCC members who passed by even got a chance to congratulate the new husband and wife. Many members of the public are likely to have similar experiences over the coming weeks, as officials' economy drives this year slow demand in the service sector. The approaching Chinese New Year usually sees a lot of public funds spent on officials' eating and drinking, at a time of conspicuous consumption across China. However, all that has changed following the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Its newly elected leadership has pledged to reduce spending on hospitality and trim bureaucratic visits and meetings. The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee in early December introduced eight rules to change officials' work style. More than 20 provinces have released detailed regulations to crack down on the three most-criticized uses of public funds for private purposes -- cars, banquets and overseas visits. For example, the Anhui provincial government in late December issued a notice to ban officials from using governmental vehicles during the New Year festival and spring festival. The governments of Gansu, Hubei and Fujian limited overseas visits to no more than once a year and banned personal tourism with public money. No official banquets are allowed in Zhejiang Province and no alcohol is to be served during officials' meals. Officials of provincial government should eat at canteens when visiting lower-level governments. In Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, meal times during work visits have been limited to 45 minutes. While people like Zhang Ben and Wu Luanluan are getting more access to in-demand restaurants and hotels, the service industry is feeling the effect of government cut-backs. \"This time used to be a peak for governmental annual meetings. But this year is gloomy. Only a few companies have chosen us and dining bookings are mostly for family meals,\" says the marketing manager of a five-star hotel in Hefei, capital of Anhui, who declined to be named. The regulations have also turned peak seasons into off-seasons for other businesses like gift firms and travel agencies which typically have a lot of clients spending public funds. \"Orders dropped 50 percent this year. We have not even had many people coming to make enquiries,\" Zhen Fei, head of Hefei Lanhe Gift Company, sighs of the build-up to Chinese New Year. High-end gifts used to be loved by government departments; however, customers are now choosing simple items like cups or notebooks, according to Zhen. \"It is getting harder to do business,\" he says. Travel agencies have lost many group orders from government departments, while companies and families have become their main clients. \"The regulations and public supervision have meant that government departments dare not cross the line,\" says Yang Xiaoling, deputy manager of Anhui Global International Travel Co. Ltd.. A \"fresh new style\" has been forming among officials, according to Yuan Longsheng of the local government in Yancheng City in Jiangsu Province. Although spending of public funds has been largely reduced, Yuan believes it is possible that it could edge back up if the crackdown is not maintained. \"It has been a chronic illness. Implementation should be tough this time,\" he urges. This illness had been treated with many methods in past years but the results were limited, according to Cheng Wenhao, professor of Tsinghua University's School of Public Policy and Management and director of its Anti-Corruption and Governance Research Center. The new regulations from central and local governments have been targeted at the core of the problems, an approach which has refreshed the work style in China, Cheng says. Cheng also points out that to fundamentally solve the problems, more policies should be established on financial management and transparency of government affairs. Public supervision should be courageous to report corruption, and real punishment should be carried out to warn others, the academic adds.

Without detailing their conversation on the hostage situation, the White House said the two leaders expressed their support for the \"international community's efforts, led by France, to deny terrorists a safe haven in Mali.\" The phone call came after the Algerian military launched an air and ground assault earlier in the day in an attempt to rescue the hostages kidnapped by a group of militants at a natural gas plant operated jointly by British Petroleum and Algerian and Norwegian companies. The Algerian official APS news agency reported Thursday that the rescue operation was over, without giving the exact casualties of the hostages. The militants are aimed at avenging Algeria's support for French military operations against Islamic militants in Mali. They claimed that they had taken 41 foreigners hostage, including American, British, French, Irish, Norwegian and Japanese citizens. Besides the hostage crisis, Obama said that the United States values \"a strong UK in a strong European Union, which makes critical contributions to peace, prosperity, and security in Europe and around the world,\" according to the White House.

Speaking at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in the capital, Holder called for immediate congressional action, to make \" significant strides in reducing the violence that too often fills our headlines and afflicts our communities.\" \"Some have said that these changes will require tough votes, by members of Congress. As you all know, public service is never easy, and there come times when those of us who are elected or appointed to positions must put the interests of those who we serve -- who we are privileged to serve, above that which might be politically expedient or professionally safe. This is one of those times,\" said Holder, who will stay on as the head of Justice Department in Obama's second term. The Attorney General urged lawmakers to enact the \"common-sense legislations\" which President Barack Obama announced on Wednesday, including universal background checks of gun sales and bans on military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. The gun reform could begin with completing the background checks system, a \"relatively simple step\", said Holder. \"Congress should move swiftly to adopt legislation to require universal background checks so that a full background check is conducted every time someone attempts to buy a gun,\" said Holder. He encouraged more private sellers to work with licensed dealers to ensure that all sales are subject to a comprehensive background check. Obama on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping package of gun violence reduction proposals, a month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting that killed 26 people including 20 schoolchildren. The measures include 23 executive actions which the president signed at the scene, and proposals that require the Congress to adopt relevant legislation to renew a bPRAan on military- style assault weapons, impose a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines and expand background checks for all gun sales. The measures, quickly assembled by a White House task force headed by Vice President Joe Biden after the December massacre sparked a nationwide debate on gun-control necessity, was deemed as the most sweeping gun-control effort in the United States in nearly two decades. However, much of the extensive federal agenda is expected to meet resistance on Capitol Hill, where hearings will be held in the next two weeks to consider those proposals, first in the Democratic-controlled Senate and then the GOP-controlled House.

Rahul Gandhi, who was unanimously elected vice president of India's oldest and biggest political party on Sunday, told a national rally of the Congress in Jaipur, western India, that \" young and impatient India\" is now demanding \"a greater role\" in decision making of the country's aging political structure. In an impassioned speech, Gandhi said the party must respect the youths' demand, but he came short of naming the latest series of unprecedented protests in India after a 23-year-old woman was brutally killed by six thugs on a moving bus in the Indian capital on Dec. 16. \"We don't need better systems, we need a complete transformation in the system, we need 40-50 leaders at the national level and seven to 10 at the state level,\" said the charismatic 42-year-old Nehru-Gandhi scion while addressing over 1, 200 delegates at the All India Congress Committee session in Jaipur. Gandhi is expected to be the prime minister's candidate in the coming general election in 2014. In the past one month after the gang rape took place, many protesters, mostly young people, have expressed their anger and frustration in a dysfunction power system of the country which they think is incapable of bringing social justice to a large part of the Indian society, especially its middle and lower level women, among numerous other serious structural flaws in the system. In an earlier speech at the party rally in Jaipur, Congress President Sonia Gandhi promised to deliver justice to the victim of the gang rape and push ahead legislations in favor of women's rights and power.

Speaking in Latin language, the 85-year-old Pope said that after deep reflection he has come to the certainty that his strengths, \"due to an advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise\" of his ministry in today's world, subject to rapid changes and questions of strong relevance. \"Well aware of the seriousness of this act, with full freedom I declare that I renounce the ministry of Bishop of Rome,\" he said adding that was quitting \"for the good of the Church.\" He also announced that he would step down from the helm of the Catholic Church at 8:00 p.m. local time (1900 GMT) on Feb.28, leaving the papacy vacant so that \"a Conclave to elect the new Supreme Pontiff will have to be convoked.\" He also said that he wishes to continue to serve the church \"through a life dedicated to prayer\". Upon resigning, he will move to the papal summer residence near Rome, and then will transfer to a cloistered residence in the Vatican. The pope's spokesman Federico Lombardi told a press conference soon after the announcement that Benedict will not take part in the conclave to elect his successor. The new pope could be elected before the end of March among several contenders in the wings. The cardinals gather in the Conclave and vote in a process of secret balloting where a two-thirds majority is needed to elect a new Pope. If after 12 days a pope has still not been chosen, a vote by simple majority is instated. Local media said that the pope's resignation came without any real prior warning or speculation, though concerns had been raised among Vatican observers about his declining health conditions over the past months. The dean of the College of Cardinals, Italian cardinal Angelo Sodano, said that the announcement was a \"bolt out of the blue,\" while outgoing Premier Mario Monti said he was \"very shocked\" by the unexpected news. Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, a BavariPRAan-born conservative theologian, served as a professor of theology at several German universities before becoming one of the most respected members of the College of Cardinals as well as one of the closest confidants of his predecessor Pope John Paul II. On 19 April 2005, Ratzinger became the 265th pope in Catholic Church's 2,000-year history. He will be the first pope to resign in nearly 600 years, meaning that for the first time in centuries there will be a living former pope. Papal resignation, which has happened four times before, is envisaged as a possibility in the Code of Canon Law, at the only conditions that it be made freely and be manifested properly. The best known example involved Pope Celestine V in 1294, who after five months as the bishop of Rome issued a decree declaring it possible that a pope can resign and then lived the rest of his days as a hermit. The last time that a pope resigned was Pope Gregory XII who stood down in 1415 to end the \"Western Schism\", which threatened to shatter Roman Catholicism.

Korean gov't condemns DPRK nuke test, steps up surveillance SEOUL, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government condemned the nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Tuesday, calling it a \"clear violation\" of UN resolutions. \"North Korea (DPRK) will not be able to avoid being held accountable for (the test),\" national security adviser Chun Yung-Woo told reporters after an emergency security meeting presided over by President Lee Myung-bak. \"In accordance with our consistent and firm principle that we will not tolerate North Korea's nuclear tests, the government will seek all measures, including those at the level of UN Security Council, to deter North Korea's nuclear ambition,\" Chun said, calling the test a \"threat\" to regional stability. President-elect Park Geun-hye, who replaces Lee later this month, \"strongly condemned\" the test and vowed to make joint efforts with the international community to denuclearize the DPRK, Park's spokeswoman Cho Yoon-sun told reporters. The underground nuclear test, which the DPRK claimed successful, was carried out at 11:57 a.m. local time (0257 GMT) in the DPRK's Kilju County, North Hamkyung Province. An artificial earthquake with a magnitude of 4.9 was detected from the town, where the DPRK's nuclear test facility is located. South Korea's military was immediately put on heightened alert to deter potential cross-border provocations, while the South Korean and U.S. forces upgraded their border surveillance level. The Defense Ministry, which estimated the explosion from the test at 6to 7 kilotons, is keeping an eye on the developments in the DPRK to monitor potential signs of additional nuclear or missile tests. Pyongyang recently vowed to proceed with missile and nuclear tests targeting the United States, its \"sworn enemy,\" to protest the UN condemnation over its Dec. 12 rocket launch. Pyongyang conducted similar nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.

Yi's remarks on the sidelines of the national legislature's annual session came after the State Council, or China's cabinet, announced Sunday a plan to dismantle the MOR into administrative and commercial arms. The proposed State Railways Administration will be under the supervision of the Ministry of Transport and perform administrative functions of the defunct MOR, while the planned China railway corporation will run commercial businesses which are controlled by the MOR. \"Although the MOR is scheduled to be broke up, construction of rail lines will continue,\" Yi said, \"thus it's very important to resolve the subsequent financing issue.\" \"A proper handling of the debt issue is good for stabilizing market expectations and carrying on railway construction,\" he said, adding that a number of national and regional banks, big or small, have been involved in the construction of railways for years. According to the MOR, China had 98,000 km of rail lines, including 9,356 km of high-speed rail lines, in operation at the end of 2012. The MOR financial statements showed the total MOR assets stood at 4.3 trillion yuan (685.6 billion U.S. dollars) as of September 2012, while the total liabilities stood at 2.66 trillion yuan, with a debt-to-asset ratio of 61.8 percent. \"The bonds and other debts of the MOR must be dealt with clearly,\" Yi said. According to the restructuring plan, the new State Railways Administration will be responsible for setting railway technology standards and supervising railway work safety, transport service quality and railway project quality, while the China railway corporation will be responsible for railway transportation dispatch and command, freight and passenger transport business management and railway construction. Minister of Railways Sheng Guangzu promised Sunday to properly solve the debts owed by the MOR, for business purposes and for public welfare as well. \"The employees will not be laid off because of the breakup,\" Sheng said, trying to reassure the ministry's 2.4 million employees. Sheng hoped private capital and foreign funds could actively participate in incorporation of the new company. The breakup plan also triggered public concerns that train fares will rise soon, as Sheng said the average train fare is \"relatively low.\" Sheng said the future pricing of train tickets should be decided by the market law. \"We will work to ensure that people can get train tickets more easily,\" he said. The MOR recorded a combined revenue of 975.2 billion yuan last year, up 15 percent from a year earlier, MOR data showed. The State Council's breakup plan for the MOR is subject to the vote of the first session of the 12th National People's Congress.

The right to demonstrate is recognized and accepted by the French. But no event should degenerate, attack public property or people,\" Hollande said during a visit to Paris main airport of Charles de Gaulle. Campaigning for same-sex marriage and adoption, Hollande called on protestors against the Socialist's social reform to \"respect the parliament and the law, and respect the universal suffrage, which was informed of my intentions when I was presented.\" \"Do not prevent the deputies from doing their work. I can not accept homophobic violence, to implicate the police or prevent public interventions,\" Hollande stressed. On Wednesday, the police arrested four men on charges of a homophobic attack at a gay bar in the northern city of Lille. Thousands of demonstrators took to Paris streets to express their refusal to permit same-sex marriage and adoption with some of them have been questioned over cars and public property damage. Despite continued and strong street opposition, France's upper house of parliament, the Senate, adopted last Friday the law that would allow same-sex marriage and grant gay couples the right to adopt children.

The victim has been undergoing treatment at the hospital where the incident took place. The judges also asked the government of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to explain why a women protester in her 60s was beaten up by policemen in the town of Aligarh last week during protests over the rape and death of a six-year-old. Both the police excesses on women protesters were caught on camera and TV channels beamed the footage all day long. \"How do you treat women in your state? Even an animal won't do what the police officers are doing every day in different parts of the country,\" the top court asked government lawyers. Though the Delhi Police had suspended the errant cop who slapped a woman protester, the Uttar Pradesh government is yet to act against the cops who brutally assaulted the aged women. Experts say that there is an immediate need to sensitize the country's police force towards women who are often reluctant to even go to cops to report any complaint of sexual assaults on them.

Gezi Park cannot continue in this way,\" Guler told reporters. The minister reiterated the government's call for protesters to differentiate themselves from \"provocateurs, marginal and illegal parties\" at the park. Some groups attempted to burn tents in Gezi Park, but the police had prevented it, he said, adding the police would continue their intervention if \"marginal groups\" keep clashing with them. He went on saying that a referendum on the future of Gezi Park will be held either in the Beyoglu district or in wider Istanbul. The demonstrations centered in the Taksim Square in Istanbul continues Thursday despite a referendum proposal by the government a day earlier for a controversial redevelopment plan in Gezi Park. The clashes between police and protesters have killed at least five people, including a policeman, and injured 5,000 people, according to local media.

Fukuda told a press conference that there was currently no emergency or pandemic, but many things about the disease remained unknown such as the animal reservoir. \"I do want to stress that there are a lot of things that we do not know. For example, one of the key pieces of missing information is that are there many people who have mild infections or asymptomatic infections that we are missing,\" said the senior health official, adding that such information would be vital for the understanding of the transmission and epidemiology of the disease. He said that the absence of that kind of information made it very hard to peer into the whole picture and make predictions. He also listed three possibilities of the disease's future development: simply fading away, the ongoing pattern continuing for some period of time or more cases or outbreaks appearing. Fukuda told reporters that based on the current situation and gaps in knowledge, WHO decided to convene an International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee next week. \"The reason why we will do this is that recognizing what we see and what we don't see. We really want be in a position to be ready for any possibility, and we want countries to be in positions to be ready for any possible directions that the virus can take,\" explained the assistant director-general. \"If in the future we do see some kind of explosions, or if there is some big outbreak, or we think that the situation has really changed, we will already have a group of emergency committee experts who are really up to speed, so that we don't have to go through a steep learning curve,\" Fukuda said, \"we just want to make sure that we can move as quickly as possible if we need to move in the future in any major directions.\" Fukuda furthered that to convene an IHR emergency committee would allow the WHO Director-General and the health organization to receive input from an external group of experts who would provide formal consultation and information. It was introduced that the IHR emergency committee on MERS-CoV was the second committee to be set up under the WHO rules which came into force in 2007. The first committee was convened in response to 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Fukuda introduced that next Tuesday, and also next Thursday if needed, WHO would convene the emergency committee on MERS-CoV, consisted of international experts specialized in different fields and whose names to be get publicly known on next Monday. The committee would be provided with information that WHO has and then review the situation, with part of input coming from countries with cases which could directly tell the committee members their perspectives and concerns, as Fukuda noted, and then it would be asked to provide views on whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and whether should WHO make additional temporary recommendations beyond what has already set.

{"doc_id": "ENG_NW_001278_20130726_F00013HDE", "document": "Tough task awaits investigators in wake of Spanish train disaster Tough task awaits investigators in wake of Spanish train disaster MADRID, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Once established that the primary cause of the Santiago de Compostela train disaster which has claimed 80 lives and left around 100 injured in north-west Spain was an excess of velocity, focus is turning as how such a train could go into a corner with a speed limit of 80 km/h at a speed of around 190 km/h. A video of the accident shown on Spanish TV and posted on virtually every news website in the country shows in graphic detail how the carriages are hurled off the tracks as a result of the excessive speed, with the second wagon appearing to jump the tracks while those behind it are twisted into tortured shapes by the stress placed upon them. The driver of the engine is the first suspect: he reportedly admitted almost directly after the accident of traveling at 190km/h. A veteran of over 30 years' service, his Facebook page has shown that he had previously made jokes about breaking the speed limit, and although that cannot be taken as proof that he habitually acted in such a way, it is worrying. The driver gave negative in a test for alcohol and is currently under police supervision in his hospital bed after being imputed to give evidence to the judge behind one of the two investigations into the tragedy. The judge is in possession of the black box which contains recordings of all of the cabin information and will be able to interrogate him on the basis of the contents of that fateful device. But even if the driver was speeding, the question as to why no automatic system kicked in to automatically slow the train down. The engine in question, an Alvia s-730, was a new model with a top speed of 250 km/h and was operating on track which had recently been laid in order to accommodate the 300km/h AVE high speed train. However, the area where the accident happened is transition zone between the high-speed line and a conventional line. The high-speed line is protected with the ERMTS system, which is a European safety system designed for trains able to travel at speeds of 300km/h, to the ASFA -200 system, more generally used on lines with a top speed of 200 km/h. Both systems are assured to be equally safe and are intended to transmit an action protocol to the cabin in function of the data collected by sensors and antenna installed along the track. Should the driver ignore the signals they are programmed to automatically brake the train and slow it down, something that failed to happen in Wednesday's disaster.

The Spanish royal family and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy are scheduled to attend to pay their respects to those who died in what is Spain's second-deadliest train crash. The tragedy happened Wednesday evening on the outskirts of Santiago de Compostela in northwest Spain when a Madrid-to-Ferrol train, carrying 218 passengers, left the tracks on a sharp curve. On Sunday, a woman hospitalized after the crash died of severe injuries, bringing the death toll so far to 79. Another 69 people were still receiving treatment in various hospitals in the region, 22 of them in critical condition (including two children), local health officials said at a press conference. Police said Friday 52-year-old Francisco Garzon Amo, driver of the train, was arrested and charged with \"reckless homicide\" Thursday at a hospital in Santiago, where he was being treated for a light head injury suffered in the accident. Amo, who has over 30 years of experience with the state train company Renfe, was reported to have admitted traveling at 190 km per hour, more than double the 80 kph speed limit for that section of track. The driver should have started slowing the train before reaching a bend that train drivers had been told to respect, the president of Spanish rail network administrator ADIF said. Amo was released on bail but banned from leaving Spain for six months after being brought to the courthouse for a two-hour closed hearing, according to local media. Rajoy on Thursday announced three days of nationwide mourning for the victims. \"This terrible accident is going to remain in our minds for a long time,\" Rajoy said. It is Spain's worst train crash since 1972 when a train collided with a bus, killing 86 and injuring 112. Flowers were placed before the ancient cathedral in Santiago de Compostela, a traditional site for celebration of a local Christian festival in honor of St. James, one of Jesus's 12 apostles. But this year's feast was canceled as the city went into mourning after the disaster, which occurred on the eve of the festival. Spanish Crown Prince Felipe, Rajoy and members of his government as well as presidents of Spain's regional authorities were to attend the memorial service, scheduled to start at 7 p.m. (1700GMT) on Monday.

Disregarding the basic facts, the resolution bluntly \"condemned\" China for so-called \"use of coercion, threats, or force\" to assert territorial claims in the East and South China Seas. It reiterated the U.S. opposition to changing the status quo of the Diaoyu Islands, called the Senkakus by Japan, while reaffirming that the U.S.-Japan security treaty covers the group of rocky isles in the East China Sea. In a statement issued Tuesday, Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and sponsor of the resolution, claimed that it was aimed at calling for a \"peaceful resolution\" of those disputes, which will affect the future of a region poised to serve as an epicenter for global economic development in the 21st century. However, the resolution is apparently self-contradictory as it will further complicate the disputes rather than pave the way for their peaceful resolution. China is the wrong party to blame for the rising tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, which were provoked by Japan in the case of the Diaoyu dispute, and by the Philippines in the case of the disputes in the South China Sea. Last year, the Japanese government took a unilateral action to \"nationalize\" the Diaoyu Islands, which were historically part of China's territory, in an attempt to legalize its act of theft. This is the origin of the current tensions in the East China Sea, in which China has shown enough patience and restraint in its moves to protect its territorial integrity. And for a long time, the Philippine navy has used force to intimidate and arrest Chinese fishermen operating legally in the South China Sea. The U.S. Senate's move also coincided with the recent conclusion of the fifth round of China-U.S. Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Washington, and the historic June summit held in California between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama. These fruitful meetings have created a renewed momentum for the development of China-U.S. relations, with the two sides agreeing to work together to build a new type of major-country relationship based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation. In this way, they have vowed to break the historical curse of zero-sum game between a resident power and an emerging one. The U.S. Senate attempts to kill two birds with one stone by reaffirming its support to Japan and the Philippines in its latest resolution. It aims to soothe the anxiety and anger of anti-China forces both at home and abroad at the recent improvement of China-U.S. ties, while serving its need to benefit from the tensions in the Asia-Pacific region to facilitate implementation of its rebalancing strategy. But U.S. politicians have underestimated China's strong will and determination to protect the sovereignty and integrity of its territory, which will never be shaken by provocations and threats of use of force by any foreign country. If the U.S. side is really sincere in its claimed goal of maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, it has to adopt an objective and fair position on the disputes in the East and South China Seas, by reining in its allies and urging them to cease provocations and hold candid peace talks with China to settle the disputes.

U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement that the decision was made out of concerns about potential harm to consumers and competitive conditions in the U.S. economy. He also said the potential harms could be resulted from owners of  \"standard-essential\" patents gaining \"undue leverage\". The decision was a blow to Apple's biggest rival, Samsung Electronics, whose devices run on Google's Android operating system, as the two competitors launched a global patent war since 2010. The U.S. International Trade Committee (ITC) determined on June 4 that certain Apple smartphones and tablets had infringed a patent owned by Samsung, the South Korean electronics conglomerate, which violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. Following this ruling, the ITC issued an exclusion order that prohibited unlicensed importing of infringing devices. The Commission also issued a cease and desist order to prevent sales of the products in the United States. However, under section 337, the U.S President may disapprove the order in the 60-day review period. This authority has been assigned to the U.S. Trade Representative. Samsung could not appeal against the veto, but it could continue to pursue its patent rights through the courts, Froman said.

According to Pastor, the Spanish government might lower speed limits on stretches regarded as risky and improve the country's rail signaling network. It will also upgrade the advance warning system on trains, which could be extended to include satellite-based technology.

The decision dealt a blow to Samsung, whose devices run on Google's Android operating system, as the two competitors launched a global patent war since 2010. But the trade panel, an independent and bipartisan body of U.S. federal government, said Samsung can continue to import and sell its infringing devices during a 60-day review period in which the Obama administration can veto the order. The two global leading smart-phone companies are embroiled in patent fights worldwide for the rapidly increasing market worth hundreds of billion U.S. dollars. And the production of a highly technology-intensive device like a smart-phone involves hundreds of patents. In a separate case brought to the ITC by Samsung, the committee ruled in June that Apple infringed some patents owned by Samsung. Following this ruling, the ITC also issued an exclusion order that prohibited unlicensed importing of infringing devices. The ITC also issued a cease and desist order to prevent sales of the products in the United States.

Samsung could not appeal against the veto, but it could continue to pursue its patent rights through the courts, said U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman. \"Unlike every other country in the world, the United States allows patent holders to seek relief from allegedly infringing competitors in both a court of law and an administrative agency,\" said William Watson, a trade policy analyst with the U.S. think tank Cato Insitute.

Police nabbed Vijay Jadhav, a school dropout in Mumbai's Dombivali district, from a video parlor early Saturday. On Friday afternoon, police arrested the first suspect, Chand Abdul Sattar, and brought him to court Saturday, said police. A 22-year-old photojournalist was gangraped by five men in a deserted textile mill in central Mumbai on Thursday. Her colleague was tied by the assaulters. Twenty police teams, including 10 from the crime branch, are tracking down the other three suspects, all identified and aged between 18 and 20. The gangrape triggered anger in India as it was reminiscent of the horrific gangrape and killing of a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus in Delhi last December.

The aid supplies are for the World Food Program (WFP) and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to meet \"the immediate humanitarian needs of Syrian refugees fleeing the violence in Syria and crossing into northern Iraq,\" associate UN spokesman Farhan Haq told the press at a daily briefing. The flight, chartered by WFP, includes 340 family tents, 42 metric tonnes of high energy biscuits and 15 metric tonnes of special nutrition bars contributed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The supplies will be distributed by WFP and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). \"More than 44,000 Syrian refugees have crossed into the Kurdish region of northern Iraq since 15 August,\" said Haq, adding that most of them are women and children sheltered in camps or collective facilities. In a news release, UNHCR and WFP said most of the newly arrived Syrians have been transferred to Kawergosk camp close to Erbil, which is now home to an estimated 15,000 refugees. According to UN humanitarian agencies, a second flight is due to arrive in Erbil on Tuesday from Adana, Turkey, with 93 metric tonnes of food, enough to feed 11,500 people for three weeks. Almost 200,000 Syrian refugees have fled into Iraq since the onset of conflict in Syria in March 2011, with some 30 percent residing in camps and 70 percent living in Iraqi communities. The Syrian civil war between government forces and armed opposition seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad, has led to the deaths of more than 93,000 people and forced over 1.7 million people to flee the Middle East country.

The unpopularity of the luxury mooncakes followed a meeting of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Commission for Discipline Inspection last week. The CPC's top disciplinary arm called for efforts to fight the \"four forms of decadence\": formalism, bureaucratism, hedonism and extravagance. Practices like giving gifts or holding banquets using public funds around festivals, such as the forthcoming Mid-Autumn Festival which falls on Sept. 19 this year, must be restrained, according to a statement after the meeting. Disciplinary departments have been urged to tighten supervision and enforcement of discipline, alerting the entire Party by exposing and punishing violators. Disciplinary arms at provincial levels have banned the use of public funds to give gifts in a bid to improve the work style of government agencies. \"These measures are sort of an extension of the 'eight-point rule' announced earlier, and the mooncake market has been affected consequently,\" said Xiao Jinming, a Shandong University law professor. China's CPC leadership, elected at a Party congress last November,introduced an \"eight-point\" rules to fight bureaucratism and formalism late last year, urging CPC officials to reduce pomp, ceremony, and bureaucratic visits and meetings. The government should introduce more systematic and tangible measures so as to eradicate corruption behind extravagant behaviors, according to experts. Xiao said the government needs to further prevent and punish corruption in the disguise of gift-giving. More importantly, gift-giving using public funds must be stopped, said He Zengke, deputy director of the government innovation institute at Peking University. \"This requires stricter budget management, supervision and audit,\" He said.

Thirty environmentalists were detained on Sept. 18-19 while they were attempting to stage a protest against oil extraction on the Prirazlomnaya oil platform stationed in the exclusive Russian economic zone.

Investigators said the saloon car which was used to ferry terrorists, weapons and explosives to Westgate shopping mall was found parked a few minutes from the Westgate mall's main entrance. \"Police offer reward of 500,000 shillings (5,800 dollars) to anyone who volunteer information on owners of KAS 575X used in Westgate Mall attack,\" Head of Anti-Terrorism Unit Boniface Mwaniki said in a brief statement received on Monday. Mwanini said they were finding difficulties in tracing Somali national Adan Dheq alias Hussein Abdi Ali alias Abdulahi Dugon Subow and Kenyan Abdikadir Haret Mohamed alias Mohamed Hussein. The counter-terrorism police said the two suspects are believed to be the owners of the Mitsubishi salon car which was seized outside the mall after the attack. The two are believed to have purchased the car using funds withdrawn from the local bank in Nairobi on Sept. 6. According to police, the two men have been living in Eastleigh which is mainly inhabited by Kenyans of Somali origin, and paid some 4,000 dollars for the purchase of the car on Sept. 6, some 15 days before the attack in which over 70 people were killed. Mwaniki also released the CCTV footage to the local television stations which two men (one light-skinned man) entering the Queensway branch of Barclays in Nairobi. The two Kenyans of Somali origin are reportedly from the Kenyan border town of Mandera which Somali militants have been using for cross border incursions. The 30 year-old Mohamed who is fluent in Kiswahili is from the Marehan clan in Mandera County near the border with Somalia. His colleague, Dheq, is fluent in Swahili as well. Unknown number of heavily armed terrorists attacked Westgate Mall, a popular upscale shopping center in Nairobi. Kenyan security services were only able to end the attack and restore order on Sept. 24. Reports said the original owner of the car was a female staff of United Nations in Nairobi who sold it to a staff of International Center for Research in Agroforestry (Icraf) in Nairobi. The ICRAF staff gave it to his brother to help in getting a buyer. The new move came after the military confirmed on Saturday that four terrorists took part in storming of an upscale Westgate shopping mall. Military spokesman Major Emmanuel Chirchir said that they have Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr were captured in the CCTV footage from the Nairobi. \"The Westage mall was attacked by the four terrorists whose names we have released to the public. Among the four, Al-Sudani is a Sudanese but we are still working on the identities of the other three and their nationalities,\" Chirchir told Xinhua by telephone. The military spokesman also confirmed the authenticity of the CCTV footage which was broadcast by a private television station in Nairobi, showing the four men strolling through the mall as they chat on their mobile phones. The four died when the part of the mall they were in collapsed and their charred bodies are undergoing DNA verification, Chirchir said. Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo police said security had been stepped up and appealed to city residents to be extra vigilant and take security measures seriously, regardless of their status in society. The authorities have particularly warned against the laxity in the screening of cars for explosives at all shopping malls and any business or social gatherings with at least 10 people at any given moment that these might be vulnerable to attacks. Kenya sent troops into Somalia to battle Al-Shabaab rebels in October 2011 after several attacks, including the kidnapping of a French woman and a British tourist – and the killing of her husband – damaged its key tourism industry.

According to a statement by his media office, Suleiman told the ambassadors of major powers and the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon Derek Plumbly that the Syrian refugees have put a severe strain on Lebanon's economy and \"the participation of countries in sharing this burden is not sufficient.\" He added \"we should follow up the funding mechanism through the support of the World Bank\" in reference to the pledges made at the International Support Group for Lebanon meeting that was held in New York in September. Suleiman reiterated the need to establish UN-protected refugee camps inside Syria to facilitate the return of the displaced. The New York meeting announced 339 million U.S. dollars in additional humanitarian aid in response to the Syrian crisis, including 74 million dollars for Lebanon to support Syrian refugees. Suleiman said the meeting was \"successful,\" but stressed \"there should be an encouragement to hold a new donors conference to assess the funding announced at the Kuwait conference.\" According to the latest United Nations Higher Council for Refugees report, there are currently over 79,2000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon, and the figure is expected to reach 1 million by year end.

Chief of Defense Forces General Julius Karangi told a news conference in Nairobi that some of the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) soldiers took part in the looting at the upscale shopping mall during the four-day siege. \"Discipline is our core driving point and we are not playing with this issue. That is why we have taken action on these soldiers. Two of them have been jailed and dismissed while a third one is under probe,\" Karangi told journalists in Nairobi. He said the two soldiers who have been dismissed from duty were found with stolen property from the Westgate mall, adding that one of the soldiers is still being probed over the incident. Karangi said the soldiers were found with mobile phones, cameras and chargers that were \"stolen\" from the mall during the siege. The development came after Defense Cabinet Secretary Rachael Omamo ordered investigations into the looting claims, warning that the government will deal firmly with any soldier involved in the alleged looting spree.

Antonio Guterres, the UN high commissioner for refugees, made the remarks when he was briefing the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Affairs Committee of the UN General Assembly on the current situation of refugees worldwide. \"Refugees are crossing borders at the highest rate in nearly two decades,\" he said. \"By the end of 2013, some two million people across the world will have been forced to flee their country -- the highest number in any year since the Rwandan genocide of 1994.\" The past three years have been marked by a quick succession of large-scale displacement emergencies, from Libya and Cote d'Ivoire to Somalia and Mali, he said. \"Millions more were displaced inside their own country.\" About 1.7 million Syrians have fled their country since January, in addition to the hundreds of thousands who became refugees across Africa -- the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Mali, and Somalia, he said. \"Together with UN partners, we are doing everything possible to respond, but our limits are being severely tested by this combination of an emergency unparalleled in the recent past, and the persistence of all the other crises around the world,\" he said. In fact, \"the burden of hosting refugee is distributed unevenly across the world -- a gap that is widening,\" he said. \"More than 80 percent of today's refugees are hosted by developing countries, up from 70 percent a decade ago.\" \"Sustaining the international refugee protection system will require enhanced support to host countries and more serious efforts by the international community toward meaningful solidarity and burden-sharing,\" he said. The current crisis in Syria, and the enormous impact which 2.2 million refugees are having on the economics and societies of neighboring countries like Lebanon and Jordan, are a case in point, he said. Although international voluntary contributions, the sole source of UNHCR's financial support, have reached unprecedented levels of 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in 2012, significant funding gaps remained, he said, adding that record will again be surpassed significantly in 2013. \"Nevertheless, significant funding gaps remain, and achieving a balance between current emergencies -- most notably now the Syrian crisis -- and persisting humanitarian needs elsewhere poses a major challenge,\" he said. The Syrian crisis, which has been going on for more than 30 months, has led to a massive influx of Syrian refugees into neighboring countries, such as Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. As the UNHCR is striving to coordinate the hosting countries in aiding more than 2 million Syrian refugees, it is also trying to deliver humanitarian assistance to the Syrians displaced inside their country. In the war-battered Syrian city of Homs, the refugee agency, using a fleet of some 250 trucks, provides aid to 14,000-15,000 households every week. Some of these people live in areas that are difficult to reach because of the conflict and insecurity. The UN refugee agency is striving to provide core relief items for 3 million internally displaced people, in addition to health care, shelter, financial aid and protection to hundreds of thousands more. It has to date helped some 2.4 million people in all of Syria's 14 governorates. About 40 percent of UNHCR's relief items have been distributed to people in dangerous areas.

According to Yang, the foreign affairs office under the ministry lodged solemn representations with the Japanese Embassy in China. Yang reiterated that China's move aims to safeguard the country's state sovereignty and territorial and airspace safety and ensure the order for flight. Yang said the move is a necessary measure for China to effectively exercise the self-defense right and conforms to the Charter of the United Nations and international laws and practices. Having established its own air defense identification zone in late 1960s, Japan has no right to make irresponsible remarks on China's setup of the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone, Yang said. According to Yang, Japan has frequently sent military planes in recent years to track and monitor Chinese military planes which were conducting normal exercises and patrols above the East China Sea in the name of entering its own air defense identification zone, which severely undermined the freedom of over-flight and made safety accidents and unexpected incidents highly likely. Yang also accused the Japanese officials of using the media to maliciously report about China's legal and normal flights in an attempt to confound public opinions and create oppositional emotions. \"Facts have proven that it is Japan who has been creating tense situations,\" Yang said. Yang stressed that the Diaoyu Islands are an inherent part of China's territory, and the country's determination and volition to safeguard its sovereignty over the islands are \"unwavering.\" \"We strongly require the Japanese side to stop all moves that undermine China's territorial sovereignty as well as irresponsible remarks that misguide international opinions and create regional tensions,\" Yang said. At the same day, Yang also made remarks over U.S. Department of Defence's so-called \"concern\" over the issue. The Foreign Affairs Office of China's Defense Ministry has lodged solemn representations with the military attache of the U.S. Embassy in China Sunday evening, Yang said. The establishment of the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone by the Chinese government is \"totally rational and indisputable,\" he stressed. According to Yang, 20-plus countries, including the United States, have set up their own air defense identification zones since the 1950s. \"The United States now raised to China blame and even opposition, which is totally groundless,\" he said. \"The current situation over the Diaoyu Islands was completely caused by the wrong words and deeds of the Japanese side,\" he said, adding that the United States \"should not choose side\" over the issue and \"make no more inappropriate remarks or send no wrong signal that may lead to the risky move by Japan.\" \"We demand the U.S. side to earnestly respect China's national security,stop making irresponsible remarks for China's setup of the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone and make concrete efforts for the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\" Yang said.

Burwell, former deputy OMB director in the Clinton administration, has served as U.S. President Barack Obama's budget chief for more than six months. Replacing the across-the-board spending cuts, the so-called sequester, is a priority for the Obama administration and the spending cuts are hurting U.S. economic growth, military and people's daily life, she said. After a partial government shutdown, a 29-member bipartisan budget negotiation committee was discussing the federal government's budget plan for the current fiscal year starting on Oct. 1 and the sequester. They have a Dec. 13 deadline to produce a plan, and no results have been announced yet. The sequester was included in the August 2011 debt-ceiling package with a total of more than 1 trillion U.S. dollars to be cut over 10 years. The federal government underwent a partial shutdown on Oct. 1-16 and only reopened after Congress approved a short-term deal to fund the government through Jan. 15 and raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7.

Heads of the UN Refugee Agency, the UN World Food Program and UNICEF, who met with the EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva in Brussels, participated in a signing ceremony for the humanitarian funding. \"The conflict in Syria has consumed tens of thousands of lives, uprooted millions from their homes, destabilised the region and consigned an entire generation of the young to an uncertain future,\" said European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. \"It is right that we stand up for the victims of this catastrophe, which is why I am proud that today we are signing some of the largest humanitarian contracts ever concluded with trusted humanitarian partners,\" he said. \"I urge the international community to follow suit and replicate our gesture of solidarity,\" he added. Georgieva said the contracts would help \"to reach even more vulnerable Syrians and those in the host communities beyond Syria's borders who are struggling under the burden of their generous hospitality.\" In Syria, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate dramatically as violence has intensified and fighting continues to spread throughout the country. The United Nations estimates that 9.3 million people are affected by the ongoing violence, with approximately 6.5 million people internally displaced. Every day of violence adds to this number.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130425.0150", "document": "PROTESTERS TARGET NRA LOBBYISTS WASHINGTON – Though the Senate showed America where it stands on gun legislation last week, citizens took to the streets and sidewalks of Washington D.C. on Thursday to voice their displeasure with the vote that killed a measure to expand background checks on guns. ''I’m personally offended,'' said Meagan Kelly, a Newtown, Conn resident. '' The President said we’ll do something about this and the Senate didn’t follow through.'' Occupy the NRA staged a protest to call out the National Rifle Association and lobbying firms with ties to the gun rights group for using big money to stonewall gun safety legislation. The group, which says it advocates for sensible gun-safety laws, rallied supporters in McPherson Square, a small park near the famous K Street. Many gun safety advocates have built an argument around the December 2012 shootings that killed 26 students and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, pushing for more stringent background checks, bans on assault weapons, and other gun-control measures. Several speakers addressed the crowd, including Nardyne Jefferies, a Washington mother who became a gun-safety advocate after her only daughter was killed in a drive-by shooting. Charles McGarry, a former Stamford, Conn., resident who stood among the crowd listening to Jefferies speak, said the NRA has a powerful grip on the political process and it’s up to citizens to make a difference. The protesters, somewhat unorganized and flanked by a small band of police on motorcycles, delivered letters to lobbying firms including Prime Policy Group, Crossroads Strategies, Denton’s, and others asking them to sever their ties with the pro-gun group. None of the lobbying groups targeted by protesters returned phone calls made by Hearst Newspapers on Thursday. The NRA and its affiliate groups are a huge political force, having spent $800,000 in lobbying efforts in this year’s first quarter, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The NRA has maintained a strong campaign to fend off control measures and advocate for arming schoolteachers following the Sandy Hook school shooting. Aaron Black, the protest’s organizer, said the event is meant to shed light on the NRA’s part in hindering progress for improving gun legislation. ''Guns aren’t going to go away. We’re not trying to get rid of guns,'' Black said. '' We want to make sure people who have them use them safely.'' Many heads turned as they walked by the scene and one passerby even shouted ''long live the Second Amendment.'' The protesters stood outside the lobbying firms’ offices, but were not allowed inside. ’'Unfortunately, I’m not surprised,'' said Kelly, who is friends with the daughter of a teacher killed at Sandy Hook.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130510.0155", "document": "PAKISTAN ORDERS NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER TO LEAVE Pakistan’s Interior Ministry has ordered the expulsion of The New York Times bureau chief in Islamabad on the eve of national elections, the newspaper said Friday. The Times has strongly protested the move and is seeking his reinstatement. The ministry gave no explanation for the expulsion order, which was delivered via a two-sentence letter by police officers to the bureau chief, Declan Walsh, at 12:30 a.m. Thursday local time at his home. “It is informed that your visa is hereby canceled in view of your undesirable activities,” the order stated. “You are therefore advised to leave the country within 72 hours.” The timing of the order means Walsh must exit Pakistan on the night of the elections. Walsh, 39, is a veteran correspondent who has lived and worked in Pakistan for nine years, most of it for The Guardian newspaper of Britain. He was hired by the Times in January 2012 and has written extensively about the country’s violent political convulsions, Islamist insurgency and sometimes tense relations with the United States, which has been conducting drone attacks on militants in Pakistan’s border areas with Afghanistan. In a letter of protest to Pakistan’s interior minister, Malik Muhammad Habib Khan, Jill Abramson, the newspaper’s executive editor, expressed concern about the order, describing Walsh as a “reporter of integrity who has at all times offered balanced, nuanced and factual reporting on Pakistan.” She asked the minister to reinstate Walsh’s visa. The accusation of undesirable activities, she wrote, “is vague and unsupported, and Mr. Walsh has received no further explanation of any alleged wrongdoing.” Walsh said the circumstances of the expulsion order’s delivery were highly unusual.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130517.0006", "document": "FOXCONN AUDIT REVEALS WORKWEEK STILL TOO LONG Foxconn Technology, the company that manufactures Apple’s popular iPads and iPhones, has made substantial progress toward improving safety and other working conditions at three of its Chinese plants dedicated to making Apple products. But it has not yet achieved the most difficult goal: reducing the average workweek to the maximum allowed by Chinese law, a global monitoring group said Thursday. The auditors, supervised by the Fair Labor Association, said Foxconn was still working toward lowering the average workweek to the 49-hour cap. And labor unions at the plants that are supposed to represent the workers’ interests are still dominated by management, the association said. Still, the average workweek has come down sharply from the typical 60 hours or more that has been common practice at the Chinese suppliers of Apple and other technology companies. Although the auditors declined to be specific about the length of the Foxconn workweek, Apple has said that it has been working to reduce the long hours put in by workers at its suppliers, which are mostly in China. In a statement on its supplier responsibility website, the company said for more than 1 million workers in its global supply network that it tracked in 2012, “the average hours worked per week was under 50.” An Apple spokesman, Steve Dowling, declined to discuss the specifics of the Fair Labor Association audit, which he said was done independently of Apple. But Dowling said Apple has been working closely with its suppliers and conducting its own monitoring to improve conditions at the factories that make its products, and the company has posted public progress reports on its website. Foxconn could not be reached for comment on Thursday. Foxconn, part of the Taiwan-based company Hon Hai Precision Industry, employs about 178,000 workers at the three factories inspected. It has about 1.2 million workers at plants making products for Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Microsoft and other technology companies. The manufacturer has been under intense scrutiny for several years because of working conditions inside its factories. Investigations by The New York Times, outside groups and Apple’s own supplier responsibility officials have found illegal amounts of overtime, crowded working conditions, underage workers and improper disposal of hazardous waste. Industrial accidents have injured and killed Foxconn workers, and the company also experienced a wave of worker suicides. Labor and consumer activists have pressured Apple, one of the most profitable companies in the world, to do more to improve conditions for the people who make its products. The monthly earnings of Foxconn workers making Apple products are currently about $500. Apple joined the Fair Labor Association, or FLA, in January 2012, and asked the group to audit its suppliers, beginning with Foxconn. The labor group has periodically inspected Foxconn factories in Guanlan, Longhua and Chengdu since February 2012 and interviewed thousands of workers. The audits are paid for by Apple. After the first inspection, Apple and Foxconn agreed to an action plan of 360 items to be completed by July 1, 2013. As of January, 98.3 percent of them had been achieved, the group’s report said. Most of the items were “housekeeping issues,” said Auret van Heerden, chief executive of the FLA, in an interview Thursday. “Those things they plowed through.” But Foxconn has also addressed more substantive problems, van Heerden said. For example, in fire safety, the company added more escape routes and cleared choke points after the auditors asked it to test the evacuation of buildings during shift change, when plants are most crowded. “We were, in a way, looking for trouble,” he said. He noted that Foxconn has also overhauled many processes, including using robots instead of people to polish the aluminum backs of iPad cases and water to capture and dispose of the resulting dust. An aluminum dust explosion in May 2011 at Foxconn’s Chengdu factory killed three workers and injured more than a dozen others. Critics of the FLA and Foxconn said the most recent audit played down problems found by other investigators, such as unpaid overtime and Foxconn’s use of unpaid interns. “Overall, the FLA’s reporting on Foxconn continues to be unjustifiably rosy,” Scott Nova, executive director of the Workers Rights Consortium, a university-backed group that monitors apparel factories worldwide, said in an email.", "event_args": [{"start": 14, "end": 20, "trigger": "REVEALS", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "mention": "FOXCONN", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 83, "end": 94, "trigger": "manufactures", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 258, "end": 263, "trigger": "making", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 226, "end": 228, "mention": "its", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 429, "end": 432, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 434, "end": 441, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1011, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 998, "end": 1002, "mention": "Apple", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1139, "trigger": "statement", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1387, "trigger": "discuss", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1635, "trigger": "make", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1540, "end": 1542, "mention": "its", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1671, "end": 1676, "trigger": "posted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1540, "end": 1542, "mention": "its", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1700, "trigger": "reports", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1745, "trigger": "reached", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1718, "end": 1724, "mention": "Foxconn", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1769, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1757, "trigger": "comment", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1718, "end": 1724, "mention": "Foxconn", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1769, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1949, "end": 1954, "trigger": "making", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1956, "end": 1963, "mention": "products", "role": "artifact"}]}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2056, "trigger": "manufacturer", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2416, "end": 2422, "trigger": "injured", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2428, "end": 2433, "trigger": "killed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2509, "trigger": "suicides", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2579, "end": 2588, "trigger": "profitable", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2666, "end": 2669, "trigger": "make", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2697, "end": 2704, "trigger": "earnings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2725, "end": 2730, "trigger": "making", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2843, "end": 2847, "trigger": "asked", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2773, "end": 2777, "mention": "Apple", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3024, "end": 3034, "trigger": "interviewed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3073, "end": 3076, "trigger": "paid", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3085, "end": 3089, "mention": "Apple", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 3276, "end": 3281, "trigger": "report", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3393, "end": 3401, "trigger": "interview", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3403, "end": 3410, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 3635, "end": 3639, "trigger": "asked", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3629, "end": 3630, "mention": "it", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3656, "end": 3665, "trigger": "evacuation", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3629, "end": 3630, "mention": "it", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 4048, "end": 4053, "trigger": "killed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 4073, "end": 4079, "trigger": "injured", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 4138, "end": 4141, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 4224, "end": 4229, "trigger": "unpaid", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 4261, "end": 4266, "trigger": "unpaid", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4130, "end": 4136, "mention": "Foxconn", "role": "recipient"}, {"start": 4130, "end": 4136, "mention": "Foxconn", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 4297, "end": 4305, "trigger": "reporting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4291, "end": 4293, "mention": "FLA", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 4500, "end": 4504, "trigger": "email", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130520.0177", "document": "THREE FOXCONN EMPLOYEES ARE SAID TO HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE SHANGHAI – Three Chinese employees at Foxconn, one of the world’s biggest contract electronics manufacturers, died in what were believed to be suicides in recent weeks, which a group that monitors labor conditions in China says is the latest indication that the company continues to be plagued by labor problems. Foxconn, a Taiwanese company that does manufacturing and assembly for some of the world’s biggest electronics brands, including Apple and Hewlett-Packard, has more than a million workers in China. In a statement Monday, Foxconn said that none of the deaths appeared to be work-related and that they all occurred outside the factories. The company also said one of the employees had not yet begun work at the company. All three were said to have jumped to their deaths from buildings. “We cannot speculate on individual reasons for these actions, but an internal review shows that there is no indication that they were caused by work-related matters. It is also important to note that experts who have reviewed such tragic incidents in the past have indicated that suicide is a complex issue and that there is no one reason that can ever be cited for any such incident,” the company said. The authorities in central China’s Henan province, where the deaths occurred, said they were investigating the cases, which the state-run news media said occurred at housing complexes that cater to Foxconn workers. The annual suicide rate in China, according to the World Health Organization, is 22.23 people per 100,000. China Labor Watch, a group that monitors Chinese labor practices, said in a news release that, “The reasons for these building jumpings are unclear.” It suggested it was related to labor practices inside the factory that limit conversation among workers. The company is trying to remake its image after a spate of worker suicides several years ago and longstanding criticism from labor groups about how it manages its factories.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130523.0220", "document": "ENVOY SAYS NORTH KOREA OPEN TO DIALOGUE BEIJING - A North Korean envoy, Marshal Choe Ryong-hae, said the North would “accept the proposal” by China to “open up dialogue,” the China News Service reported Thursday. The comments were reported after the Choe met Liu Yunshan, a member of the Communist Party Standing Committee and the politician who heads ideological affairs for the Communist Party. Liu was quoted as saying that China wanted a resumption of talks that would result in the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula “as soon as possible.” Chinese officials frequently make such appeals. Choe, who arrived in China, North Korea’s biggest benefactor, on Wednesday on a fence-mending mission, is a close aide to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, and as such, what he says is taken relatively seriously. Few diplomats believe that the North is prepared to be involved in six-party talks that aim to strip North Korea of its nuclear weapons. Such talks among the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia collapsed in 2008 after North Korea walked out. The regime has continued to persist with its nuclear weapons program ever since, despite constant pleas by China to stop. Choe, 72, was quoted by the China News Service as being “highly” appreciative of “China’s huge efforts to maintain peace and stability” on the Korean Peninsula. There have been no reports so far of Choe meeting with senior Chinese officials involved in foreign policy and military affairs. The publicized meetings have been with senior officials of the Communist Party who are the usual interlocutors with North Korea. On Wednesday, Choe met with Wang Jiarui, head of the International Department of the Communist Party of China. The North Korean news agency said Choe visited an industrial park in Beijing on Thursday. China’s basic advice to North Korea is reform of its economy should follow the path of Deng Xiaoping with special economic zones and some private enterprise. Choe’s visit is being watched closely by North Korean experts in China. They say they detect little change in China’s underlying policy of supporting North Korea. But the Chinese leadership would like North Korea to modify its erratic behavior, stop nuclear tests and halt its missile program, they say. How to reach that goal with Kim had not been resolved, some of the experts said. China should begin to treat North Korea as a normal country and should resist extremes of sheltering it or abandoning it, said Wang Gunsheng, an analyst at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Wang said the visit of Choe could be interpreted as a “kind of apology” by North Korea by China for its recent behavior, including conducting its third nuclear test in February.", "event_args": [{"start": 6, "end": 9, "trigger": "SAYS", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 0, "end": 4, "mention": "ENVOY", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 31, "end": 38, "trigger": "DIALOGUE", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 96, "end": 99, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 160, "end": 167, "trigger": "dialogue", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 142, "end": 146, "mention": "China", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 194, "end": 201, "trigger": "reported", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 203, "end": 210, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 217, "end": 224, "trigger": "comments", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 250, "end": 253, "mention": "Choe", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 231, "end": 238, "trigger": "reported", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 250, "end": 253, "mention": "Choe", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 255, "end": 257, "trigger": "met", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 250, "end": 253, "mention": "Choe", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 405, "end": 410, "trigger": "quoted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 397, "end": 399, "mention": "Liu", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 456, "end": 460, "trigger": "talks", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 427, "end": 431, "mention": "China", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 487, "end": 493, "trigger": "removal", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 427, "end": 431, "mention": "China", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 621, "end": 627, "trigger": "arrived", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 676, "end": 684, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 617, "end": 619, "mention": "who", "role": "person"}, {"start": 632, "end": 636, "mention": "China", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 789, "end": 792, "trigger": "says", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 786, "end": 787, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 902, "end": 906, "trigger": "talks", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 892, "end": 900, "mention": "six-party", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 920, "end": 924, "trigger": "strip", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 892, "end": 900, "mention": "six-party", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 967, "end": 971, "trigger": "talks", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1024, "end": 1028, "mention": "China", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1041, "end": 1046, "mention": "Russia", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1237, "trigger": "quoted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1404, "trigger": "reports", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1416, "end": 1419, "mention": "Choe", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1427, "trigger": "meeting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1416, "end": 1419, "mention": "Choe", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1530, "trigger": "meetings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1617, "trigger": "interlocutors", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1658, "trigger": "met", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1651, "end": 1654, "mention": "Choe", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1640, "end": 1648, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1777, "end": 1780, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1793, "trigger": "visited", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1782, "end": 1785, "mention": "Choe", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1835, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1857, "trigger": "advice", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1838, "end": 1842, "mention": "China", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2003, "end": 2007, "trigger": "visit", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1996, "end": 1999, "mention": "Choe", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 2061, "end": 2065, "mention": "China", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2075, "trigger": "say", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2068, "end": 2071, "mention": "They", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2375, "end": 2378, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2503, "end": 2506, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2591, "end": 2595, "trigger": "visit", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2577, "end": 2580, "mention": "Wang", "role": "entity"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130524.0107", "document": "Furloughs may stretch hurricane forecasters With hurricane season approaching and the devastating Oklahoma tornado only days past, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is considering mandatory furloughs for all employees, including weather forecasters. The proposal has produced sharp reaction from meteorologists and an elected official. ''The severe weather events in Oklahoma this week have further convinced me that we should not take any chance that avoidable furloughs might result in a degradation of weather prediction and forecasting services,'' Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-Va., wrote in a letter Wednesday to the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA. Facing a $192 million shortfall because of sequestration, NOAA has proposed furloughing each of its roughly 12,000 employees for four days this summer, said spokeswoman Ciaran Clayton. The plan calls for each worker to take two furlough days in July and August, starting July 5. Though Clayton said the furloughs would be difficult, she said NOAA has little time to manage the shortfall before the end of the fiscal year in September because Congress did not pass its spending bill until late March. ''We really weren’t left with an option to not have these furlough days happen during hurricane season,'' Clayton said. Hurricane season begins on June 1. Clayton said NOAA will make sure the National Hurricane Center in Miami is adequately staffed at all times, even if the agency moves forward with furloughs. Civilian employees at MacDill Air Force Base who work on NOAA’s fleet of weather planes, the ''Hurricane Hunters’' that fly into storms to collect data, would be furloughed. But Clayton said some of the people responsible for operating the planes are part of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, which would be exempt from the cuts. If weather models show a hurricane approaching the Gulf Coast around the time of a mandated off-day, Clayton said, NOAA would consider canceling the furlough. But such a cancellation would work only with storms that give days of warning, said Dan Sobien, head of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. ''There are other times when storms just pop up in the gulf and you don’t have that kind of lead time,'' Sobien said. Many weather service centers already operate with minimal staffing, he said. Sobien said furloughs could leave some weather service stations without the resources needed to send up weather balloons, potentially leading to less-accurate forecasts. He said employees working on short-staffed furlough days could also become fatigued. ''Nobody’s going to intentionally not issue a warning or let somebody die because of something, but I fear that people won’t be making as sharp decisions,'' said Sobien, a Tampa forecaster who also serves as union president. Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for Weather Underground, said potential furloughs in August at the peak of hurricane season could be dangerous. ''Odds are they’ll get away with it,'' Masters said. '' But you could have a surprise situation where some significant weather blows up on that day when it wasn’t expected.'' The importance of quick and accurate forecasts in severe weather was borne out this week with the massive Oklahoma tornado. Weather service meteorologists were credited with saving lives when the storm hit Moore, Okla., killing two dozen people. Clayton said employees issued their first warning 16 minutes before the tornado touched down, four minutes faster than the average. NOAA is still in the process of deciding how it will address its budget shortfall, Clayton said. Zachary T. Sampson can be reached at zsampson@tampabay.com or (727) 893-8804.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130526.0005", "document": "THOUSANDS MARCH IN FRANCE AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE PARIS - Thousands of French marched Sunday, France’s Mother’s Day, to protest the recent legalization of gay marriage. Despite initial worries, the demonstration was largely peaceful, with the police estimating that about 150,000 people took part. Separately, the French police said they were continuing to search for the man responsible for stabbing a uniformed soldier in the neck Saturday evening, an act that may have been inspired by the murder of a British soldier last week in retaliation for Western military intervention in Muslim countries. The anti-gay marriage march occurred as a recent poll shows many French are losing patience with the protests against the “marriage for all” law that passed May 18. The demonstrations have broadened to include those angry at the president for his overall leadership and some far-right protesters who have been violent. Marchers converged from three parts of Paris to the esplanade in front of the Invalides. There was a separate, smaller march by conservative Christians. In general, the demonstrations against the law have been a combination of religious leaders and their followers, opposed to the gay marriage on religious grounds, and more conservative French, many of them Roman Catholic, who believe that gay couples should have equal rights, but within an institution other than marriage. Many also object to the new ability of gay married couples to adopt children, arguing that a child should be raised by a man and a woman. In the prelude to the protest, on Saturday night, 59 people were arrested after chaining themselves to metal barricades on the Champs-Élysées. On Sunday, 19 demonstrators were arrested after they climbed onto the headquarters of the Socialist Party and unfurled a banner demanding that President François Hollande resign. Police officers also seized a van with masks, banners and smoke bombs, and near the end of Sunday’s demonstration, they used tear gas to break up a gathering of some masked protesters believed to be rightists known as “ultras.” As an indication of the confusion around the focus of Sunday’s march, the main opposition party, the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, or UMP, was split on whether to join. The party’s president, Jean-François Copé, urged participation, while other party dignitaries, like former foreign minister, Alain Juppé, urged people to remain at home. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, a Socialist, accused the UMP of \"sparking tension and radicalization.'' With much advance publicity, the first gay marriage is supposed to take place Wednesday in Montpellier, sometimes called the San Francisco of France. The case of the wounded soldier, Pfc. Cédric Cordier, 23, is being handled by France’s anti-terrorism court, officials said Sunday. He was stabbed in the back of the neck with a box cutter or short knife as he patrolled with two colleagues through the transport station of La Défense, a business area in a western suburb of Paris. Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian visited the soldier in the hospital and said that he had been targeted because he was a soldier. Initial reports said the assailant was a man of North African appearance, about 30 years old, with a small beard. By the time the two soldiers patrolling in front could react, the man had disappeared into a crowd. Cordier was in stable condition at a military hospital; the knife missed his jugular vein, doctors said. The police suggested Sunday that the deed may have been inspired by the attack on a British soldier in a London street Wednesday. A spokesman for the police union UNSA, Christophe Crépin, said there were similarities with the London attack. “I think this person wanted to imitate what happened in London,” he told TELE television. But Interior Minister Manuel Valls, who ordered the terrorism investigation, said it was too early to determine the motivation for the attack because the police had yet to arrest a suspect or gather enough evidence to offer credible theories about what inspired it.

Adebowale was formally charged with murder last week, and Adebolajo appeared in a magistrate’s court Monday to be formally arraigned. He was also charged with other offenses, including the attempted murder of two police officers and possession of a revolver, identified as a 9.4-mm KNIL model 91. Weapons experts said the revolver is a large-bore, antique handgun first manufactured in the Netherlands in the late 19th century. According to reporters in the Westminster Magistrates Court, Adebolajo was wearing a white T-shirt and blew a kiss to an unidentified man in the public gallery. Both men then pointed to the sky. For his part, Adebowale appeared at the Old Bailey criminal court and was told he would return for a preliminary hearing June 28 when the cases against both men would be heard together. He did not seek bail, news reports said. The proceedings came after a weekend in which crowds added floral tributes to the thousands of bouquets left by well-wishers in the Woolwich neighborhood where Rigby was killed in full view of passers-by as he returned to an army barracks wearing a T-shirt with the name of a military charity. While some mourned, others protested, and violent clashes broke out near the Parliaments in London and Edinburgh between rightists demonstrating against Islamic militancy and others promoting tolerance. In other cities, extreme rightists confronted campaigners opposed to racism and fascism. Scores of people were arrested in London on public order offenses after the police broke up fights.", "event_args": [{"start": 25, "end": 30, "trigger": "MURDER", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 15, "end": 21, "mention": "SOLDIER", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 76, "end": 82, "trigger": "hacking", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 198, "end": 203, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 115, "end": 119, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 157, "end": 164, "trigger": "appeared", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 231, "end": 234, "trigger": "meet", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 198, "end": 203, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 208, "end": 218, "mention": "politicians", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 474, "end": 479, "trigger": "murder", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 503, "end": 507, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 474, "end": 479, "mention": "murder", "role": "crime"}]}, {"start": 663, "end": 669, "trigger": "killing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 691, "end": 694, "trigger": "shot", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 711, "end": 716, "mention": "police", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 700, "end": 706, "trigger": "wounded", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 711, "end": 716, "mention": "police", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 755, "end": 760, "trigger": "murder", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 755, "end": 760, "mention": "murder", "role": "crime"}, {"start": 719, "end": 727, "mention": "Adebowale", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 787, "end": 794, "trigger": "appeared", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 820, "end": 825, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 777, "end": 785, "mention": "Adebolajo", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 918, "end": 923, "trigger": "murder", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 853, "end": 854, "mention": "He", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1035, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1100, "trigger": "manufactured", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1109, "end": 1119, "mention": "Netherlands", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1158, "trigger": "According to", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1373, "trigger": "appeared", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1356, "end": 1364, "mention": "Adebowale", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1419, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1356, "end": 1364, "mention": "Adebowale", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1435, "trigger": "return", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1379, "end": 1380, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1744, "trigger": "killed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1729, "end": 1733, "mention": "Rigby", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1786, "trigger": "returned", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1570, "end": 1571, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1771, "mention": "passers-by", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1890, "end": 1898, "trigger": "protested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1869, "end": 1872, "mention": "some", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1905, "end": 1911, "trigger": "violent", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1883, "end": 1888, "mention": "others", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1913, "end": 1919, "trigger": "clashes", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1966, "end": 1974, "mention": "Edinburgh", "role": "place"}, {"start": 1955, "end": 1960, "mention": "London", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1994, "end": 2006, "trigger": "demonstrating", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1955, "end": 1960, "mention": "London", "role": "place"}, {"start": 1966, "end": 1974, "mention": "Edinburgh", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2024, "end": 2032, "trigger": "militancy", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1966, "end": 1974, "mention": "Edinburgh", "role": "place"}, {"start": 1955, "end": 1960, "mention": "London", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2110, "trigger": "confronted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2177, "end": 2184, "trigger": "arrested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2189, "end": 2194, "mention": "London", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2245, "trigger": "broke up", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2189, "end": 2194, "mention": "London", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2247, "end": 2252, "trigger": "fights", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2189, "end": 2194, "mention": "London", "role": "place"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130613.0034", "document": "Houston news Despite President Barack Obama’s pledge of support for the people of West, federal disaster officials have declined to pay for millions of dollars in damages caused by a deadly fertilizer plant explosion in the small Texas town. ''We have determined that a major disaster declaration is not necessary,'' Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Craig Fugate wrote in a letter to Gov. Rick Perry. Perry called for the president to be ''true to his word’' and help deliver assistance to the devastated community. Fourteen people were killed, 200 were injured and dozens of homes were severely damaged in the April 17 blast at the West Fertilizer Co. West Mayor Tommy Muska said rebuilding will continue despite local frustration over the FEMA decision. '' We’re not going to panic,'' he said. '' It’s more a kick in the teeth than a bump in the road.'' The agency has provided about $6.5 million in disaster aid to homeowners and small businesses in West, according to a recent statement from FEMA. The denial covers public assistance, commonly used to rebuild community assets like roads, water lines and public buildings. Based on estimates from city officials, West sustained tens of millions of dollars in damage to local infrastructure, including roads and sewer lines. School district officials have estimated the cost of rebuilding an intermediate school at  $40 million. It is not uncommon for FEMA to deny requests. The agency last summer rejected Minnesota’s request for additional aid for flood-damaged homes and businesses, and in 2011 it rejected requests in Alabama after houses were destroyed by a tornado. Texas has 30 days to appeal the denial and is assessing options, said Josh Havens, a spokesman for Perry. It’s not unusual for FEMA to turn down that level of assistance for emergencies not stemming from natural disasters. In 2010, for example, officials denied a request for millions in aid after a gas pipeline explosion that consumed a Northern California neighborhood. ''We know that the community has met the thresholds established by FEMA to qualify for public assistance and we have provided the information required to show as much,'' Havens said. The denial, issued by FEMA’s Washington office, followed an April 25 appearance by the president in Waco. The president promised the nation would not forget the tragedy. ''We may not all live here in Texas, but we’re neighbors, too,'' Obama told a capacity crowd at Baylor University’s Ferrell Center. '' We’re Americans, too. And we stand with you and we will not forget, and we’ll be there even after the cameras leave and after the attention turns elsewhere.'' Perry said he was disappointed with the decision. ''We anticipate the president will hold true to his word and help us work with FEMA to ensure much-needed assistance reaches the community of West,'' Perry said in a statement. Muska, echoing that disappointment, noted he was angry because the country ''can spend billions of dollars in other countries, but won’t help a little Texas town.'' ''We’re not stingy or want gold-plated carpet,'' he said. '' We just want to replace some pipes.'' FEMA officials in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. The explosion, caused by a stockpile of ammonium nitrate, remains under investigation by state and federal agencies. Last month, officials ruled out natural causes, smoking and water used by firefighters as possible causes. Two, seemingly-simultaneous explosions gouged a 93-foot-wide crater at the plant and damaged 100 nearby buildings, mostly homes. Meanwhile, West residents most affected by the explosion, notably those closest to the plant, are still displaced, interim city secretary Jennifer Schaffer said. Some continue living with friends or in a local hotel. Residents of homes closest to the plant are advised to boil water as officials rebuild and test water lines. Rebuilding began days after the explosion, as people were slowly allowed back to assess the damage to homes. In a statement, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he was confident state and local officials would support rebuilding. ''This wonderful town deserves nothing less,'' Cornyn said.

Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, an A-rated National Rifle Association member who has angered gun rights groups by pushing for stronger background checks, is back on television with a rifle in his hands. But Manchin, a Democrat who appeared in a 2010 campaign commercial that showed him firing a bullet through a piece of environmental legislation, is taking aim at the NRA this time, at least in the figurative sense. In a new commercial, the senator, who is not up for re-election until 2018, tries to turn the tables on the NRA, which has accused him of walking away from his commitment to honor the Second Amendment. “West Virginia, you know me. I haven’t changed,” said Manchin, who was governor of the state before he was elected senator. “Now I believe that we can protect the Second Amendment and make our community safer. I think most law-abiding gun owners agree with me.” He says defiantly that he does not march in lock step with the NRA’s Washington leadership. The ad is rich with imagery that is meant to resonate in West Virginia’s sports-shooting culture. Manchin is shown strolling through a field, aiming the rifle and polishing it as he sits in the back of a pickup truck. The ad is a direct response to an NRA television campaign against Manchin. The gun group has been running an ad in West Virginia accusing Manchin of siding with President Barack Obama and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, an ardent proponent of gun control who has been waging his own campaign against senators who do not support gun control.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130720.0209", "document": "A SHUFFLE OF ALUMINUM, BUT TO BANKS, PURE GOLD This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. - Hundreds of millions of times a day, thirsty Americans open a can of soda, beer or juice. And every time they do it, they pay a fraction of a penny more because of a shrewd maneuver by Goldman Sachs and other financial players that ultimately costs consumers billions of dollars. The story of how this works begins in 27 industrial warehouses in the Detroit area where Goldman stores customers’ aluminum. Each day, a fleet of trucks shuffles 1,500-pound bars of the metal among the warehouses. This industrial dance has been choreographed by Goldman to exploit pricing regulations set up by an overseas commodities exchange, an investigation by The New York Times has found. The back-and-forth lengthens the storage time. And that adds many millions a year to the coffers of Goldman, which owns the warehouses and charges rent to store the metal. It also increases prices paid by manufacturers and consumers across the country. Tyler Clay, a forklift driver who worked at the Goldman warehouses until early this year, called the process “a merry-go-round of metal.” Only a tenth of a cent or so of an aluminum can’s purchase price can be traced back to the strategy. But multiply that amount by the 90 billion aluminum cans consumed in the United States each year - and add the tons of aluminum used in things like cars, electronics and house siding - and the efforts by Goldman and other financial players has cost American consumers more than $5 billion over the last three years, say former industry executives, analysts and consultants. The inflated aluminum pricing is just one way that Wall Street is capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to sway a variety of commodities markets, according to financial records, regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities. The maneuvering in markets for oil, wheat, cotton, coffee and more have brought billions in profits to investment banks while forcing consumers to pay more. In the case of aluminum, Goldman bought Metro International Trade Services, one of the country’s biggest traders of the metal. Goldman Sachs says it complies with all industry standards and there is no suggestion that these activities violate any laws or regulations. Metro International, which declined to comment for this article, in the past has attributed the delays to logistical problems, including a shortage of trucks and forklift drivers, and the administrative complications of tracking so much metal.

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) WASHINGTON - Wall Street’s lucrative commodities businesses came to the fore here Tuesday as a Senate panel questioned whether banks should be allowed to control warehouses, pipelines and other infrastructure used to store and transport essential goods. The hearing, convened by the Senate Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection subcommittee, came as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and others face growing scrutiny over their role in the commodities markets and the extent to which their activities can inflate prices paid by manufacturers and consumers. The Federal Reserve is reviewing the potential risks posed by the operations, which have generated many billions of dollars in profits for the banks. The hearing followed an article in The New York Times on Sunday that explored the operations of warehouses controlled in part by Goldman Sachs. The bank’s tactics, along with those of other financial players, have inflated the price of aluminum and ultimately cost consumers billions of dollars, an investigation by The Times found. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is now gathering information on the warehouse operations. Several witnesses at Tuesday’s hearings warned that letting the country’s largest financial institutions own commodities units that store and ship vast quantities of metals, oil and the other basic building blocks of the economy could pose grave risks to the financial system. The ability of those bank subsidiaries to gather nonpublic information on commodities stores and shipping also could give the banks an unfair advantage in the markets, the witnesses said. Representatives from the financial industry did not testify Tuesday, but Goldman Sachs for the first time addressed its role in the aluminum market. In a statement posted on its website, Goldman said that its ownership of aluminum warehouses did not affect prices of the metal, in part because only 5 percent of the aluminum that is used in manufacturing passes through the warehouses owned by Goldman and others. Goldman controls 27 warehouses in the Detroit area that are used to store aluminum for customers. Saule T. Omarova, a law professor at the University of North Carolina who has studied the issue, told the subcommittee that there was one other company that was an early leader in combining the practice of moving physical commodities with the financing of market activity - Enron. The comparison was seized upon by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. “The notion that two of largest financial companies are adopting a business method pioneered by Enron,” she said, “suggests that this movie will not end well.”", "event_args": [{"start": 359, "end": 368, "trigger": "questioned", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 333, "end": 339, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 478, "end": 486, "trigger": "transport", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 413, "end": 422, "mention": "warehouses", "role": "thing"}, {"start": 425, "end": 433, "mention": "pipelines", "role": "thing"}, {"start": 378, "end": 382, "mention": "banks", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 509, "end": 515, "trigger": "hearing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 776, "end": 779, "trigger": "paid", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 678, "end": 682, "mention": "their", "role": "giver"}, {"start": 784, "end": 796, "mention": "manufacturers", "role": "giver"}, {"start": 802, "end": 810, "mention": "consumers", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 784, "end": 796, "trigger": "manufacturers", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 784, "end": 796, "mention": "manufacturers", "role": "giver"}, {"start": 802, "end": 810, "mention": "consumers", "role": "giver"}, {"start": 678, "end": 682, "mention": "their", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 940, "end": 946, "trigger": "profits", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1226, "trigger": "cost", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1228, "end": 1236, "mention": "consumers", "role": "recipient"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1206, "mention": "aluminum", "role": "thing"}]}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1324, "trigger": "Trading", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1540, "trigger": "ship", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1776, "trigger": "shipping", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1746, "end": 1756, "mention": "commodities", "role": "thing"}]}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1918, "trigger": "testify", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1920, "end": 1926, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2014, "end": 2022, "trigger": "statement", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2034, "end": 2036, "mention": "its", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2213, "trigger": "manufacturing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2215, "end": 2220, "trigger": "passes", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2469, "end": 2472, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2578, "end": 2583, "trigger": "moving", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2615, "end": 2623, "trigger": "financing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}]}

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) The Obama administration has vetoed a product ban that would have forced Apple to stop selling some iPhones and iPads in the United States this week, a rare intervention by the White House and a victory for Apple in its heated patent war with Samsung Electronics. The U.S. International Trade Commission in June ordered a ban of older-model Apple products that worked with AT&amp;T’s network, including the iPhone 4 and 3GS, after determining that Apple had violated a patent that Samsung owned related to transmission of data over cellular networks. The administration had until Monday to weigh in. It was the first time that an administration had vetoed an International Trade Commission ban since 1987, according to Susan Kohn Ross, an international trade lawyer for Mitchell Silberberg &amp; Knupp. Michael Froman, the U.S. trade representative and the president’s adviser on international trade issues, wrote in his decision that it was based in part on the “effect on competitive conditions in the U.S. economy and the effect on U.S. consumers.” Apple argued that Samsung had committed to licensing its patents related to wireless technology standards, but was refusing to keep that promise. Samsung said Apple refused to pay licensing fees for its patents. Samsung said Saturday that it was disappointed, adding, “The ITC’s decision correctly recognized that Samsung has been negotiating in good faith and that Apple remains unwilling to take a license.” Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said, “We applaud the administration for standing up for innovation in this landmark case.” She added, “Samsung was wrong to abuse the patent system in this way.” Froman said his decision did not mean that Samsung was “not entitled to a remedy. On the contrary, the patent owner may continue to pursue its rights through the courts.” Samsung and Apple were once tight partners - the South Korean company makes some key parts needed to produce iPhones and iPads. But over time, as they made products that competed in different markets, their friendship turned into rivalry. The companies, which together rake in all of the profits in the handset industry, have been using patents as weapons to fight each other in the United States and other countries. Last year, a California jury awarded Apple $1 billion in damages after deciding that Samsung had violated the American company’s mobile patents, though the amount was reduced to $599 million.", "event_args": [{"start": 372, "end": 378, "trigger": "selling", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 358, "end": 362, "mention": "Apple", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 991, "end": 999, "trigger": "according", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1197, "trigger": "wrote", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1388, "trigger": "licensing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1355, "end": 1361, "mention": "Samsung", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1494, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1483, "end": 1489, "mention": "Samsung", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1515, "trigger": "pay", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1496, "end": 1500, "mention": "Apple", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1560, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1562, "end": 1569, "mention": "Saturday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1555, "mention": "Samsung", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1678, "trigger": "negotiating", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1610, "end": 1612, "mention": "ITC", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1555, "mention": "Samsung", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1788, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2189, "end": 2193, "trigger": "makes", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2226, "trigger": "produce", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2270, "end": 2273, "trigger": "made", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2265, "end": 2268, "mention": "they", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2413, "trigger": "profits", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2422, "end": 2428, "mention": "handset", "role": "thing"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130810.0221", "document": "GUN RIGHTS CELEBRATION AT STARBUCKS? NOT IN NEWTOWN The nation’s gun owners declared Friday Starbucks Appreciation Day, but in Newtown, Conn., not everyone seemed very appreciative. Instead, the local Starbucks closed five hours early, disappointing some gun owners who had planned to show up wearing holstered pistols to make a statement in favor of gun rights and Starbucks’ policies. The plan had already infuriated many residents still reeling from the murder of 26 children and educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December. Earlier, however, about two dozen gun rights supporters, some wearing pistols, camouflage or Connecticut Citizens Defense League T-shirts, showed up to show their support. The company said it had no participation in the event. Matt Botalli, 30, who owns a landscaping company in Ridgefield, was among the gun owners who planned to show up with half a dozen armed friends at the Newtown Starbucks in a national effort by gun owners to show their appreciation for Starbucks’ policy, which allows customers to carry weapons into their stores in states where it is legal. Companies have the option of banning weapons if they choose. “Come down, meet me and my friends,'' Botalli wrote on his Facebook page. ” I guarantee there will not be a safer public place in all of CT.\" “This isn’t to make a spectacle or terrorize anyone,'' he said early Friday afternoon, adding that he regularly carried his Smith &amp; Wesson pistol to coffee shops. He added: ”This was just about going to the local Starbucks and having a cup of coffee together. And that’s still my plan. I’m not going there to stomp my feet or march around in a circle.'' Earlier, the Newtown Action Alliance issued a statement, discouraging gun rights groups from holding Starbucks Appreciation Day in Newtown. “Our community is still healing, and we find it reprehensible that they are picking Newtown to rally,” the statement said. Po Murray, the vice chairwoman of the group, called the plan “tasteless and insensitive” and said that just as Starbucks does not allow smoking within 25 feet of its buildings, it should take a stand on gun violence by not allowing customers to carry weapons there. Instead, the local Starbucks closed about 4:30 p.m., instead of its usual 9:30 p.m. shutting time. A handwritten sign on the door read: \"Out of respect for Newtown and everything our community has been through, we have decided to close our store early today.'' Usually associated with latte and cappuccino rather than Smith &amp; Wesson, Starbucks has drawn praise from gun owners and criticism from anti-gun groups for its policy allowing people to openly carry guns in states, like Connecticut, that allow it. The National Gun Victims Action Council said that unlike companies like California Pizza Kitchen, Peet’s Coffee and Tea, Ikea and Disney, Starbucks had declined to ban guns from its stores. Starbucks said it chose simply to follow the laws as they exist in all states. The anti-gun group has identified Starbucks as its first economic target and has sponsored a 2-year-old boycott of the company by “gun victims, survivors, their friends, family members, faith groups and all who want sane gun laws.” It says that the boycott has cost the company $11.5 million per year, and that it plans to step up its pressure on Starbucks in the future. The group says the efforts to openly display handguns at restaurants and coffee shops is part of a national effort to \"normalize the carrying of guns in public places.'' It said: “Starbucks’ pro-gun policy on open carry makes it an active supporter of the gun lobby’s agenda to put more guns in more places in American life - and it must stop.” On the other hand, gun owners have singled out Starbucks for praise and support. A Facebook page said gun supporters should thank Starbucks “for standing up for our right to bear arms by going there on Friday.” Starbucks has found itself in the middle of controversy before, mostly on the other side of the political spectrum, over its support for gay marriage. “Our longstanding approach to the open carry debate has been to comply with local laws and statutes in the communities we serve,'' said Zack Hutson, a company spokesman. ” We continue to encourage customers and advocacy groups from all sides of the debate to share their input with their elected officials, who make the open carry laws that our company follows.''", "event_args": [{"start": 76, "end": 83, "trigger": "declared", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 85, "end": 90, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 285, "end": 291, "trigger": "show up", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 329, "end": 337, "trigger": "statement", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 201, "end": 209, "mention": "Starbucks", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 457, "end": 462, "trigger": "murder", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 528, "end": 535, "mention": "December", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 677, "end": 685, "trigger": "showed up", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 722, "end": 725, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 869, "end": 875, "trigger": "show up", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1049, "trigger": "carry", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1032, "end": 1040, "mention": "customers", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1057, "mention": "weapons", "role": "artifact"}]}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1171, "trigger": "Come", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1170, "end": 1171, "mention": "me", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1182, "trigger": "meet", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1170, "end": 1171, "mention": "me", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1217, "trigger": "wrote", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1205, "end": 1211, "mention": "Botalli", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1427, "trigger": "carried", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1378, "end": 1383, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1365, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1507, "end": 1511, "trigger": "going", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1607, "end": 1611, "trigger": "going", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1599, "end": 1599, "mention": "I", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 1613, "end": 1617, "mention": "there", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1643, "trigger": "march", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1613, "end": 1617, "mention": "there", "role": "destination"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1599, "mention": "I", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1721, "trigger": "statement", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1902, "end": 1906, "trigger": "rally", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1874, "end": 1877, "mention": "they", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1897, "mention": "Newtown", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1922, "trigger": "statement", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1891, "end": 1897, "mention": "Newtown", "role": "place"}, {"start": 1874, "end": 1877, "mention": "they", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2144, "trigger": "violence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2175, "end": 2179, "trigger": "carry", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2162, "end": 2170, "mention": "customers", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2135, "mention": "gun", "role": "artifact"}]}, {"start": 2653, "end": 2657, "trigger": "carry", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2636, "end": 2641, "mention": "people", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 2659, "end": 2662, "mention": "guns", "role": "artifact"}]}, {"start": 2748, "end": 2751, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3108, "end": 3110, "trigger": "gun", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3011, "end": 3019, "mention": "Starbucks", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3238, "end": 3241, "trigger": "cost", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3791, "end": 3794, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3881, "end": 3885, "trigger": "going", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3887, "end": 3891, "mention": "there", "role": "destination"}, {"start": 3855, "end": 3857, "mention": "our", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 3873, "end": 3876, "mention": "arms", "role": "artifact"}, {"start": 3896, "end": 3901, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 4187, "end": 4190, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 4315, "end": 4319, "trigger": "share", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4253, "end": 4261, "mention": "customers", "role": "entity"}]}]}

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) A female photographer with an English language magazine was raped by five men in Mumbai, India, on Thursday evening, undercutting Mumbai’s image as the rare Indian city where women can safely move about in public spaces. The assault echoed the gang rape and murder of a woman in New Delhi in December, which set off an unprecedented wave of protests. The woman, 22, arrived at the abandoned, desolate compound of Shakti Mills, a defunct textile factory, around 6 p.m., accompanied by a male colleague. She was taking photographs of the area, now a trendy hub for media and advertising companies, for a magazine article about Mumbai’s tenements for workers who were once employed in the mills. Under Indian law, the authorities may not release the name of a rape victim or, in this case, the name of her employer. The authorities said that five men accosted and assaulted the two journalists inside the compound. The male journalist was tied up and beaten before the young woman was raped. Doctors said she had suffered external and internal injuries but that she was expected to recover. On Friday morning, in an unusually rapid response, the Mumbai police arrested one of the five attackers, and the police said they had identified the others. “One of the five has been arrested and he admitted he was there along with some others,” Singh said at a news conference Friday afternoon. The police have released sketches of the five men. While Mumbai, India’s financial capital, is widely considered one of the country’s safest cities, recent events have brought that into question. According to statistics from the Praja Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Mumbai, 207 rape cases were registered in the city in 2011 and 2012, a 15 percent increase over 2010.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130828.0109", "document": "End of trial brings relief to Killeen By Scott Huddleston Staff Writer FORT HOOD--Local residents and community leaders celebrated the death sentence given Wednesday to Nidal Hasan and the end of a long, arduous quest for justice. Barbara Gee, a longtime Killeen resident whose husband died nine months ago, said she had mixed feelings about the sentence. Gee was on Fort Hood when the shooting occurred in 2009. '' I’m glad (Hasan) got what he deserved. But in a way I wish he could be kept alive and have to suffer,'' Gee said. '' Everybody here wishes that son of a gun never existed.'' Gee and her husband, a veteran, were at the commissary on the sprawling post when it was placed on lockdown the day of the shootings. '' We were hearing that there were multiple gunmen, and they told us to get away from the windows,'' Gee recalled. '' They said that if we had anything frozen, we should put it back because they didn’t know when we could leave.'' John Crutchfield, president and CEO of the Greater Killeen Chamber of Commerce, said he was told during a tour of the post Wednesday that the building where 13 people were killed will be razed, and a memorial put on the site. Fort Hood officials could not confirm that. The former Soldier Readiness Processing center, or Building 42003, has remained a fenced-off crime scene. Local news updates, security barriers on the post and reminders to the community to be on heightened alert for security threats during the trial also have kept the tragedy at the forefront. '' I think obviously everyone is relived that it’s over with,'' Crutchfield said. '' As we see the physical changes with the building and security barriers coming down, we’ll also see emotional changes start to occur.'' Killeen, which adopted ''Where Freedom Grows’' several years ago as its motto, reflecting the city’s ties to one of the world’s largest military installations, will keep ''making lemons into lemonade,'' Crutchfield said. Killeen has relied on the Army as its economic mainstay since Camp Hood was established during World War II. The chapter in local history that began with the worst shooting ever on a U.S. military base is rivaled only by a 1991 mass shooting in Killeen. In that case, George Hennard killed 23 people at a Luby’s restaurant, then turned the gun on himself, in the third-deadliest shooting in U.S. history. Although Hasan’s death sentence will go to an automatic appeal, he will soon be on a one-way flight out of Texas. Hasan, who was treated at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio for five months after the shooting, has since been kept at the Bell County Jail in nearby Belton. He may be flown as early as Thursday to Fort Leavenworth, Kan. Jerry Haisler, a longtime Killeen-area resident and former president of the local chamber, said Fort Hood-Killeen can start a new chapter. '' It is a good day,'' Haisler said. '' This certainly brings some closure for the families that have been affected.'' '' It’s a very tight-knit community,'' he said. '' This has affected everyone because we’re all family here. Finally, people can move on to the other things in life.'' Part of that process will be completion of a memorial pavilion honoring victims of the shooting that is planned in Killeen. Troy Kelley, a Vietnam veteran and sculptor who is working the project, said a life sentence for Hasan would not have provided a platform the victims’ families need to heal. '' It’s a healing process that probably will never end,'' said Kelley, who is working with a committee that has raised $130,000 for the project but still must collect $250,000. The group has yet to work out details of how the markers of the memorial will explain what happened at Building 42003 on Nov. 5, 2009. But Kelley said he does not want any specific references to Nidal Hasan in the memorial. '' I don’t even want to mention that SOB’s name,'' he said. shuddleston@express-news.net End of trial brings relief to KilleenKilleen residents celebrated the death sentence and end to the Fort Hood trial", "event_args": [{"start": 286, "end": 289, "trigger": "died", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 308, "end": 311, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 386, "end": 393, "trigger": "shooting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 407, "end": 410, "mention": "2009", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 713, "end": 721, "trigger": "shootings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 785, "end": 788, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 790, "end": 791, "mention": "us", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 780, "end": 783, "mention": "they", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 945, "end": 949, "trigger": "leave", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 898, "end": 899, "mention": "it", "role": "artifact"}, {"start": 860, "end": 861, "mention": "we", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1037, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1049, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 994, "end": 995, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1063, "trigger": "tour", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 994, "end": 995, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1077, "end": 1085, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1131, "trigger": "killed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1145, "trigger": "azed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1077, "end": 1085, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1317, "end": 1321, "trigger": "crime", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1347, "trigger": "updates", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1330, "end": 1334, "mention": "Local", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2047, "trigger": "established", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2132, "trigger": "shooting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2144, "end": 2147, "mention": "U.S.", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2194, "end": 2201, "trigger": "shooting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2184, "end": 2187, "mention": "1991", "role": "time"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2212, "mention": "Killeen", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2249, "trigger": "killed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2330, "end": 2333, "trigger": "dead", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2340, "end": 2347, "trigger": "shooting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2459, "end": 2464, "trigger": "flight", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2430, "end": 2431, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2473, "end": 2477, "mention": "Texas", "role": "origin"}]}, {"start": 2564, "end": 2571, "trigger": "shooting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2589, "end": 2592, "trigger": "kept", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2613, "end": 2616, "trigger": "Jail", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2628, "end": 2633, "mention": "Belton", "role": "place"}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2489, "mention": "who", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2646, "end": 2650, "trigger": "flown", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2664, "end": 2671, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 2636, "end": 2637, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2756, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2725, "end": 2736, "mention": "Killeen-area", "role": "place"}, {"start": 2758, "end": 2766, "mention": "president", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 2790, "end": 2793, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3154, "end": 3163, "trigger": "completion", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3240, "end": 3246, "mention": "Killeen", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 3212, "end": 3219, "trigger": "shooting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3240, "end": 3246, "mention": "Killeen", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 3321, "end": 3324, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3535, "end": 3540, "trigger": "raised", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3582, "end": 3588, "trigger": "collect", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130924.0050", "document": "GHANAIANS MOURN A POET AND SCHOLAR The rain has beaten me And the sharp stumps cut as keen as knives I shall go beyond and rest, I have no kin and no brother, Death has made war upon our house DAKAR, Senegal - Ghanaian schoolchildren memorized those lines from the 1960s by one of their country’s most famous poets, Kofi Awoonor; their sorrow over the newly liberated continent’s travails foreshadowed, in a terrible way, the violence that took Awoonor’s life Saturday. Awoonor - poet, diplomat, statesman, scholar and cultural icon in his native Ghana - was killed in the terrorist attack by Somali militants on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya. His death at 78 has shocked citizens in Ghana, the West African nation whose difficult beginnings and subsequent steadying he accompanied and chronicled. Awoonor published novels and books of verse, including poems like “Songs of Sorrow” that were required reading for several generations of Ghanaian schoolchildren. He was his country’s ambassador to the United Nations in the early 1990s, taught at universities in the United States and Ghana, knew W.E.B. DuBois, and was president of Ghana’s Council of State, a governmental advisory body. News reports in Ghana said he had been invited to a conference in Nairobi and had gone to the mall to have breakfast with his son, who was wounded in the attack. “He had a huge influence on Ghanaian poetry and Ghanaian academia,” said Akwasi Aidoo, a Ghanaian who is executive director of TrustAfrica, a pan-African good-governance foundation, who knew Awoonor for nearly 40 years. “He was one of the first poets after Ghanaian independence.” Because Awoonor was imprisoned for his activism during a time of repression in the mid-1970s, “we saw him more as an organic intellectual, as somebody who was not just confined to academia, somebody interested in the broader economic and social struggle,” Aidoo said. His poetry was heavily influenced by the funeral dirges of his native Ewe people, one of Ghana’s smaller ethnic minorities; his grandmother was an Ewe dirge singer, according to the Poetry Foundation. The early poetry that gained him his reputation in the 1960s in Ghana “reflected the challenges that Ghana and Africa were going through during the postcolonial period,” Aidoo said. “He was constantly emphasizing the pain, the pain and suffering of our people.” “Songs of Sorrow,” perhaps his best-known poem, is an extended lament for a world of African difficulty and hardship, replete with foreboding of latent chronic violence of the sort that erupted Saturday in Nairobi. A pan-Africanist and admirer of Kwame Nkrumah, the president who led Ghana to independence and was overthrown in a coup, Awoonor was pained by the continent’s early travails. “Funeral dirges - he used that form to lament the state of Africa, the oppression,” said Esi Sutherland-Addy, an associate professor at the University of Ghana. “It was a convenient form to talk about oppression.” Public figures in Ghana, including President John Dramani Mahama, expressed their sorrow at Awoonor’s death. “I think we’re all in shock,” Sutherland-Addy said.", "event_args": [{"start": 174, "end": 176, "trigger": "war", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 159, "end": 163, "mention": "Death", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 426, "end": 433, "trigger": "violence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 440, "end": 443, "trigger": "took", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 559, "end": 564, "trigger": "killed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 470, "end": 476, "mention": "Awoonor", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 583, "end": 588, "trigger": "attack", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 652, "end": 656, "mention": "Kenya", "role": "place"}, {"start": 470, "end": 476, "mention": "Awoonor", "role": "target"}]}, {"start": 663, "end": 667, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 659, "end": 661, "mention": "His", "role": "victim"}, {"start": 699, "end": 703, "mention": "Ghana", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1213, "trigger": "reports", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1218, "end": 1222, "mention": "Ghana", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1247, "trigger": "invited", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1229, "end": 1230, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1274, "mention": "Nairobi", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1263, "trigger": "conference", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1229, "end": 1230, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1274, "mention": "Nairobi", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1287, "trigger": "gone", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1229, "end": 1230, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1274, "mention": "Nairobi", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1347, "trigger": "wounded", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1229, "end": 1230, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1361, "trigger": "attack", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1333, "end": 1335, "mention": "who", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1435, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1674, "trigger": "imprisoned", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1653, "end": 1659, "mention": "Awoonor", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2536, "end": 2543, "trigger": "violence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2461, "end": 2467, "mention": "African", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2690, "end": 2699, "trigger": "overthrown", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2642, "end": 2650, "mention": "president", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 2706, "end": 2709, "trigger": "coup", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2642, "end": 2650, "mention": "president", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 2850, "end": 2853, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2825, "end": 2830, "mention": "Africa", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 3046, "end": 3054, "trigger": "expressed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3082, "end": 3086, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3072, "end": 3078, "mention": "Awoonor", "role": "victim"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130925.0184", "document": "BEFORE KENYA ATTACK, REHEARSALS AND PLANTING OF MACHINE GUNS EDS: SUBS for complete writethru; CHANGES byline; NEW headline.) ; (This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) NAIROBI, Kenya - The plot was hatched weeks or months ago on Somali soil, by al-Shabab’s “external operations arm,” officials say. A team of English-speaking foreign fighters was carefully selected, along with a target: Nairobi’s gleaming Westgate mall. The building’s blueprints were studied, down to the ventilation ducts. The attack was rehearsed and the team dispatched, slipping undetected through Kenya’s porous borders, often patrolled by underpaid - and deeply corrupt - border guards. A day or two before the attack, powerful belt-fed machine guns were secretly stashed in a shop in the mall with the help of a colluding employee, officials say. At least one militant had packed a change of clothes so he could slip out with fleeing civilians after the killings were done. That is the picture emerging from American security officials of the massacre at the Westgate mall, which killed scores of people over the weekend. After a four-day standoff, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya claimed Tuesday to have finally “ashamed and defeated our attackers,” declaring that the last militants still holed up inside the mall had been killed, though the bodies of many civilians, perhaps dozens, have yet to be recovered. Kenyatta contended that “intelligence reports had suggested that a British woman and two or three American citizens may have been involved,” but said that he could not confirm those reports. American officials said that they had not determined the identities of the attackers and were awaiting DNA tests and footage from the mall’s security cameras, but that they did know the massacre was meticulously planned to draw “maximum exposure.” “They had people in there, they had stuff inside there,” said an American security official who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “This was all ready to go when the shooters walked in.” Kenya is now entering an official three-day mourning period to mark one of the most unsettling episodes in its recent history. The authorities here, in a country widely perceived as an oasis of peace and prosperity in a troubled region, are struggling to answer how 10 to 15 Islamist extremists could lay siege to a shopping mall, killing more than 60 civilians with military-grade weaponry, then hold off Kenyan security forces for days.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131009.0136", "document": "EDNOTES: (FOR USE BY NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE CLIENTS) Walsh wins first round © 2013 The New York Times Felix Arroyo would have been happy to talk to Marty Walsh on the phone the other night. They needed to discuss whether ÂArroyo was willing to endorse him for mayor, but the conversation did not need to be in person. Walsh is ''a finalist for mayor, and he doesn’t have time to meet with everyone, especially at the end of a long day of campaigning,'' said Arroyo, his former rival. '' But he said, 'Look, just come over.' I went to his house at 10:30 with my papers on poverty and the achievement gap, and I didn’t leave until 12:30. It was a great conversation. He didn’t even ask whether I would support him. We just talked.'' Arroyo said they bonded, especially over their shared history as sons of immigrants: Arroyo’s parents are from Puerto Rico, Walsh’s from Ireland. '' His story is like the story of a lot of people in my community,'' Arroyo said. For John Barros -- who, like Arroyo, was eliminated in the preliminary mayoral vote last month -- the process of deciding whom to back was more deliberate. He met with John Connolly at Haley House, the Dudley Square coffee shop that doubles as Barros’s unofficial office. Then he met with Walsh and decided they were closer to each other on both style and substance. So there the three of them were in ÂEgleston Square Tuesday, Barros and ÂArroyo enthusiastically endorsing Walsh and, in doing so, possibly changing the calculus of the mayor’s race. Together they boost Walsh among constituencies with which he was expected to struggle. The backing of these rivals dents the Âstereotype of Walsh as just a union guy from Dorchester who cannot hope to win enough support outside that base to get elected. The support of Barros, who made just as much of an issue of the schools as Connolly, helps address the notion that Connolly is the only finalist who is serious about improving the schools. As it turned out, education was a front-burner issue Tuesday. The city school bus drivers’ wrong-headed and illegal work stoppage -- or slowdown, or whatever that was -- quickly became a campaign issue. Connolly promptly called for the drivers to return to work or face serious sanctions. For him, this union-driven skirmish was a political gift. But Walsh handled it well, too, declaring unequivocally that the drivers should immeÂdiately get back to work. When a reporter asked if the job action left the proudly prolabor candidate ''between a rock and hard place,'' Walsh calmly replied, ''There’s no rock and no hard place here. I come down on the side of the children.'' Arroyo’s endorsement of Walsh was Âexpected, given their mutual veneration of organized labor. Barros’s endorsement was less predictable. Walsh’s appeal tends to be personal and emotional, while Barros has never seen a policy he didn’t want to pick apart. But the two men connected. ''When you talk to Marty, he talks about relational things, the people he’s helped,'' Barros said. '' That’s great, but he has to talk about those things in broader terms, and he will.'' Months of appearing together in forum after forum have made the candidates astute critics of one another. '' Marty will go to personal stories, and I’ll say, 'That’s why we need affordable housing!' â(euro) ‰’' Barros said with a laugh. What do the endorsements mean? It’s more than a boost among communities of color and progressives or even their networks of impassioned supporters. These guys also love to campaign. They won’t just endorse and walk away. Walsh had hoped to announce three Âmajor endorsements Tuesday. He has been courting third-place finisher Charlotte Golar Richie, as well. Barros and Arroyo met with her as late as Saturday to urge her on board, but her next move remains a mystery. While Connolly is battling hard to Âimprove his performance among voters of color, Walsh has won the first round. Perhaps the most important message sent Tuesday is that this election may be decided on different turf than any mayor’s race in Boston’s history.", "event_args": [{"start": 145, "end": 148, "trigger": "talk", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 172, "end": 176, "trigger": "phone", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 280, "end": 291, "trigger": "conversation", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 265, "end": 269, "mention": "mayor", "role": "position"}, {"start": 257, "end": 259, "mention": "him", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 384, "end": 387, "trigger": "meet", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 394, "end": 401, "mention": "everyone", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 360, "end": 361, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 458, "end": 461, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 394, "end": 401, "mention": "everyone", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 360, "end": 361, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 517, "end": 520, "trigger": "come", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 496, "end": 497, "mention": "he", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 531, "end": 534, "trigger": "went", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 529, "end": 529, "mention": "I", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 622, "end": 626, "trigger": "leave", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 529, "end": 529, "mention": "I", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 656, "end": 667, "trigger": "conversation", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1125, "trigger": "met", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1120, "end": 1121, "mention": "He", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1246, "trigger": "met", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1237, "end": 1238, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1257, "mention": "Walsh", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1759, "end": 1765, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2178, "end": 2183, "trigger": "called", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2160, "end": 2167, "mention": "Connolly", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2344, "trigger": "declaring", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2308, "end": 2312, "mention": "Walsh", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2431, "end": 2435, "trigger": "asked", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2545, "trigger": "replied", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2481, "end": 2489, "mention": "candidate", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 2927, "end": 2930, "trigger": "talk", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2935, "end": 2939, "mention": "Marty", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 2923, "end": 2925, "mention": "you", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3135, "end": 3139, "trigger": "forum", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3147, "end": 3151, "trigger": "forum", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3580, "end": 3587, "trigger": "announce", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3615, "end": 3621, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 3561, "end": 3565, "mention": "Walsh", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3717, "end": 3719, "trigger": "met", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3741, "end": 3748, "mention": "Saturday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 3710, "end": 3715, "mention": "Arroyo", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3902, "end": 3904, "trigger": "won", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3892, "end": 3896, "mention": "Walsh", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3984, "end": 3991, "trigger": "election", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4035, "end": 4039, "mention": "mayor", "role": "person"}, {"start": 4051, "end": 4056, "mention": "Boston", "role": "place"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131010.0200", "document": "OSHA CITES OWNER OF TEXAS FERTILIZER PLANT THAT EXPLODED WASHINGTON – The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited the company that owns the fertilizer plant in West, Texas, for safety violations following a massive explosion at the facility in April, which left 15 dead and leveled the surrounding area. OSHA fined Adair Grain, Inc., parent of the West Fertilizer Co., $118,300 for 24 serious violations. The explosion exposed workers to ammonium nitrate chemical burns and created inhalation hazards in the plant. The OSHA report stated that the company failed to develop a communication plan in cases of emergency or create a safe working environment. It is also being fined for having inadequate ventilation systems and improper chemical storage techniques. ''The employer did not furnish employment and a place of employment which was free from recognized hazards that were causing or likely to cause death,'' the report stated. Democratic California Sen. Barbara Boxer, chair of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, announced the fines and violations Thursday, asserting that similar explosions can be prevented with proper oversight. ''All of these things are pretty much standard operating procedure,'' Boxer said. OSHA, a division of the Department of Labor, works with several other agencies, including the Chemical Safety Board, to ensure proper and safe working conditions, and has been investigating the West explosion for months. Daniel Horowitz, managing director for the CSB, said the agency is working to understand what exactly caused the West Fertilizer Co. plant to explode and where there were regulatory gaps in identifying potential hazards. ''What our team is focusing on is why did this fire progress to an ammonium detonation and how should that storage be made safer,'' Horowitz said. Dan Keeney, a spokesman for West Fertilizer Co., said the company’s attorneys are still reviewing the citations, but based on their initial review, OSHA’s allegations don’t appear to be specifically related to the April explosion. But the plant could have had better safety management years before the explosion happened, said Congressman Bill Flores, R-Bryan, whose district includes West. Flores said plant managers should have had a stronger safety program in place – one of the citations in the OSHA report – to prevent similar large-scale accidents, which are often built up over time and not caused by a single mistake. CSB testimony from a committee hearing in June revealed the West plant had not been inspected by a federal agency since 1985. ''If the plant had been run in a safer manner, then we wouldn’t be having this discussion today,'' Flores said. '' It shows that we still have a lot of work to do in terms of mitigating the risks from these types of facilities.'' The government’s investigation into the plant’s explosion isn’t complete, and OSHA and other federal agencies are working together to determine its cause, Boxer said. But the current government shutdown has prevented federal efforts to improve safety conditions in chemical facilities. All but three of the 40-person CSB staff are furloughed, including all 10 of the people investigating the West explosion, Horowitz said. ''Our problems are really acute right now,'' he said. The CSB has been working with agencies of each state to locate ammonium nitrate facilities and identify similar potential hazards, but their investigation has been delayed because of the shutdown. Horowitz said the agency also has been analyzing eyewitness videos of the explosion to ''dissect’' what happened seconds before the blast. The last time Flores visited West was in early September, and he said although residents have built new houses in the area and reopened schools, the town still has a long way to go – as do the agencies investigating it as they face uncertain fiscal times. ''In our current fiscal environment, we have to do more with less,'' Flores said. '' The federal government has never been very efficient, but it’s going to have to learn how to be efficient. We just don’t have the resources to fund everything we’d like to fund.''", "event_args": [{"start": 281, "end": 284, "trigger": "dead", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 278, "end": 279, "mention": "15", "role": "victim"}, {"start": 260, "end": 264, "mention": "April", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 480, "end": 484, "trigger": "burns", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 443, "end": 449, "mention": "workers", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 540, "end": 545, "trigger": "report", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 535, "end": 538, "mention": "OSHA", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 591, "end": 603, "trigger": "communication", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 921, "end": 925, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 934, "end": 939, "trigger": "report", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1055, "trigger": "announced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1082, "end": 1089, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1520, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1889, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2162, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2222, "end": 2225, "mention": "West", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2341, "end": 2346, "trigger": "report", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2336, "end": 2339, "mention": "OSHA", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2467, "end": 2475, "trigger": "testimony", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2463, "end": 2465, "mention": "CSB", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2494, "end": 2500, "trigger": "hearing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2505, "end": 2508, "mention": "June", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2668, "end": 2677, "trigger": "discussion", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2641, "end": 2642, "mention": "we", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 2679, "end": 2683, "mention": "today", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 3157, "end": 3159, "trigger": "hed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3653, "end": 3659, "trigger": "visited", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3661, "end": 3664, "mention": "West", "role": "destination"}, {"start": 3646, "end": 3651, "mention": "Flores", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 3697, "end": 3700, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3633, "end": 3634, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3726, "end": 3730, "trigger": "built", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3633, "end": 3634, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 4116, "end": 4119, "trigger": "fund", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4080, "end": 4081, "mention": "We", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 4145, "end": 4148, "trigger": "fund", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4132, "end": 4133, "mention": "we", "role": "giver"}]}]}

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) SPRINGDALE, Utah - In the 10 days since Zion National Park closed its gates, the community on its doorstep has become a shutdown ghost town. Hotel rooms are dark, and housecleaners are working half-shifts. Herds of campers and sightseers have streamed away along the only highway out of town, and canceled reservations from New Zealand, California and Germany are piling up every day. “The phone’s still ringing, unfortunately,” said Dean Cook, manager of the Zion Park Inn, which lost about $19,000 in business during the first week of the federal government shutdown. “We thought of not answering it for a while.” The shutdown has pinched millions of Americans, from furloughed federal workers to poor mothers seeking food aid, but its economic toll is particularly concentrated in gateway communities to national parks, from Gatlinburg, Tenn., to Estes Park, Colo., to here in southwest Utah, where local businesses live or die on tourist traffic. On Thursday, people here welcomed the news that federal officials would allow states to reopen some national parks if they used their own money to run them - an expensive proposition for any state government. Governors in Utah, South Dakota, Colorado and Arizona have been urging the Interior Department to reopen the parks, or allow states to do so if they paid for some day-to-day operations. In Utah, officials were scrambling to find the money to put the park rangers and employees back to work - Zion alone costs $50,000 a day to operate - and determine which parks might open first and whether the state would be repaid once the shutdown ends. “We’re just figuring this out,” said Ally Isom, a spokeswoman for Utah’s governor, Gary R. Herbert. It has gotten so bad that four counties in Utah have declared a state of emergency. The closure of Zion has cost about $3.5 million in visitor spending, according to a report by the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, using data from the research firm Headwaters Economics. The report estimates that the shutdown is costing parks communities across the country about $76 million per day. “This is as dangerous to us as an earthquake,” said Rebecca McKown, whose family owns The Spotted Dog restaurant. As the closure drags on, anger has turned into action. Last week, about a dozen protesters climbed over the metal gates and walked through the park. Another protest march is planned for Saturday. Similar protests, dubbed Occupy Yellowstone and Occupy Yosemite, have sprung up outside other parks.", "event_args": [{"start": 424, "end": 436, "trigger": "streamed away", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 408, "end": 417, "mention": "sightseers", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 396, "end": 402, "mention": "campers", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 571, "end": 575, "trigger": "phone", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 610, "end": 613, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 770, "end": 778, "trigger": "answering", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 752, "end": 753, "mention": "We", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 857, "end": 859, "trigger": "hed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1129, "trigger": "traffic", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1405, "end": 1410, "trigger": "urging", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1490, "end": 1493, "trigger": "paid", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1485, "end": 1488, "mention": "they", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1585, "trigger": "put", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1530, "end": 1533, "mention": "Utah", "role": "place"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1544, "mention": "officials", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1648, "trigger": "costs", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1633, "end": 1636, "mention": "Zion", "role": "place"}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1616, "mention": "employees", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1756, "trigger": "repaid", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1817, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1935, "end": 1942, "trigger": "declared", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1990, "end": 1993, "trigger": "cost", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1981, "end": 1984, "mention": "Zion", "role": "org"}]}, {"start": 2025, "end": 2032, "trigger": "spending", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2017, "end": 2023, "mention": "visitor", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2055, "trigger": "report", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2017, "end": 2023, "mention": "visitor", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2104, "trigger": "ire", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2207, "end": 2213, "trigger": "costing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2326, "end": 2329, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2473, "end": 2482, "trigger": "protesters", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2484, "end": 2490, "trigger": "climbed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2517, "end": 2522, "trigger": "walked", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2556, "trigger": "protest", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2579, "end": 2586, "mention": "Saturday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2558, "end": 2562, "trigger": "march", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2579, "end": 2586, "mention": "Saturday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2597, "end": 2604, "trigger": "protests", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2614, "end": 2619, "trigger": "Occupy", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2637, "end": 2642, "trigger": "Occupy", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}]}

The company years ago abandoned trade shows because its retail stores worldwide became a better showcase for its new products. Asymco, a research firm, estimated that Apple’s stores bring in $13 million per store in revenue a quarter on average. In a management shake-up last year, Apple fired its executive in charge of retail, John Browett. The move was not surprising to outsiders: Last August, the company publicly apologized for a plan by Browett to cut back on staffing at its stores. In 2011, Ron Johnson, the former Apple executive in charge of retail, left the company to take the helm at J.C. Penney. It was a bad fit, and after 17 months, Johnson was pushed out of Penney. Ahrendts’ role at Burberry will be filled by the company’s chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey, Burberry said in a statement. Before joining the British retailer, Ahrendts served in leadership roles at Liz Claiborne and Donna Karan International. She and Bailey have been working together at Burberry for nearly a decade, a period in which they transformed its image from stale and stodgy to sexy and chic. “I am thrilled that Angela will be joining our team,” Cook said in a statement. “She shares our values and our focus on innovation, and she places the same strong emphasis as we do on the customer experience.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131025.0125", "document": "ESTY PRAISES GAY RIGHTS GROUP FOR IMPROVING TOLERANCE NORA LINDTNER WASHINGTON – Rep. Elizabeth Esty, D-Conn., received a rousing welcome at the PFLAG National convention Friday when she delivered the keynote speech to the organization and recounted her family’s work with the advocacy group. PFLAG, formerly known as Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, has worked to increase public tolerance and understanding for the gay community, which has been the subject ''of media caricatures and fear and lack of understanding,'' Esty declared. The freshman House member noted that her mother, Mitzi Henderson, became active in PFLAG after her son Jamie – Esty’s brother – told his family in 1978 that he was gay. Henderson was president of PFLAG from 1992-1996 and worked for marriage equality and an end to discrimination in the workplace and in healthcare, Esty said. The lawmaker said she had become interested in gay rights before her brother’s announcement and made her first speech on the topic in high school at the age of 16. ''Now, as you can imagine this is a pretty unusual topic in 1975 in Winona, Minn. – a town where hog and cattle production was a sought-after course they offered at our high school,'' Esty joked. That was the start of her career-long advocacy of gay rights. ''In my own improbable path from Supreme Court lawyer working on AIDS policies in the 1990s to PTA mom in the 1990s to the local town council to the State House, and last year to Congress, I have worked hard to ensure that I model and support love and respect for all people,'' she told the PFLAG meeting in the Mayflower Hotel where she received a standing ovation. Throughout her career, Esty has supported the LGBT community, voting for full marriage equality in 2009 while a member of the Connecticut legislature, co-sponsoring legislation to increase equality and signing the amicus brief to challenge the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in the Supreme Court. The court overturned DOMA on June 26, a decision that Esty said made her feel proud not only because it was a victory for those in the LGBT community, but also because her mother had been among those who testified against the law in 1996 before a Senate committee. ''On that day, I felt particularly proud to be Mitzi Henderson’s daughter, proud of the contributions she and so many advocates like her and like you have made to our nation’s progress towards equality. Progress that is not simply the result of politics – but that is the result of something far more powerful – love,'' Esty said. '' Like all of us, I was overjoyed in June when the court made the historic decision to end DOMA and correct this moral and constitutional injustice.''", "event_args": [{"start": 6, "end": 11, "trigger": "RAISES", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3, "end": 3, "mention": "Y", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 160, "end": 169, "trigger": "convention", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 171, "end": 176, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 209, "end": 214, "trigger": "speech", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 171, "end": 176, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 183, "end": 185, "mention": "she", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 542, "end": 549, "trigger": "declared", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 481, "end": 485, "mention": "media", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 680, "end": 683, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 699, "end": 702, "mention": "1978", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 957, "end": 968, "trigger": "announcement", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 989, "end": 994, "trigger": "speech", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1163, "trigger": "production", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1102, "end": 1105, "mention": "1975", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1585, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1578, "end": 1580, "mention": "she", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1597, "end": 1603, "trigger": "meeting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1591, "end": 1595, "mention": "PFLAG", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1580, "mention": "she", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2176, "trigger": "testified", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2197, "end": 2200, "mention": "1996", "role": "time"}]}]}

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) After nearly a month of upheaval at The Philadelphia Inquirer, including the firing of the paper’s top editor and lawsuits among its owners, the majority owners Wednesday offered to buy out the minority investors, in what they described as an effort to provide stability to the company. George E. Norcross III and William P. Hankowsky, both majority owners in the Philadelphia Media Network, which also publishes the Philadelphia Daily News and Philly.com, said they wanted to put an end to the infighting. So they offered to buy out two minority investors, H.F. Lenfest and Lewis Katz, for $29 million, which they said represented nearly a 12 percent profit in the 18 months since they made the original investment. “We did not want or initiate the litigation that has created a sideshow that will ultimately waste hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars in legal fees that could be used to further strengthen and build the company,” Norcross and Hankowsky said. Norcross, a Democratic power broker, and Lenfest, a parking lot magnate, were among a group of investors who bought the struggling newspaper in April 2012. The investor group then hired back William K. Marimow, who had served as the Inquirer’s top editor from 2006 to 2010. While there appeared to be conflicts among investors from the start, these battles culminated in Marimow’s firing on Oct. 7. Three days later, Katz and Lenfest sued, claiming that Marimow should be reinstated because the firing took place without their consultation. Then Norcross countersued.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131101.0055", "document": "Rubio's not the guy for heavy lifting Times Columnist First, a confession. It is probably true that I’ve watched Jimmy Stewart’s Mr. Smith Goes to Washington too many times. A naive young man finds himself appointed to the United States Senate and heads off to the nation’s capital believing he will be able to do good things, improve people’s lives and make a difference. Did I mention Frank Capra’s movie is a delusional, surreal fantasy? Now we have ''Mr. Rubio Goes to Washington,'' the melodramatic tale of an ambitious Sammy Glick of the Potomac, a smooth operator who sees his Senate seat not as a noble call to public service but as an entry to the best front and center table at Fox News. Sen. Marco Rubio isn’t a weather vane, tacking to the latest polling whim. He’s the perpetually spinning propeller atop the freshman beanie. Where does he stand on anything? What time is it? Since being elected to the Senate in 2010, Rubio has passed more fundraising buffet tables than legislation. For a nanosecond, he had a chance to lead, only to finally say: ''My immigration bill? What immigration bill? Who said anything about an immigration bill?'' Rubio this week abandoned a sweeping immigration bill that he helped pass with bipartisan support in the Senate that provides an eventual path to citizenship for those in the country illegally but after a lengthy period of time and payment of a fine. Now Rubio says it would be too hard to get the measure through the House. Instead Rubio calls for itty-bitty, baby-step immigration reforms. Passing legislation is supposed to be hard. It’s supposed to require wheeling and dealing, horse-trading, compromise and negotiation. That’s what real senators do. Given Rubio’s aversion to heavy lifting, you could argue he’s not a U.S. senator at all. He’s a U.S. City Council member — with a book deal. To serve in the United States Senate, even with the bickering, partisan dysfunction and glacial pace, is an opportunity to try to accomplish big things and affect the course of the nation’s history. Not for Rubio. It’s too hard. The water carrier from the Heritage Foundation has been too busy caressing his ambitions and avoiding any semblance of believing in anything that hasn’t been poll-tested. First, Rubio opposed immigration reform. Then he supported a piecemeal approach. Then he was in favor of comprehensive legislation. Now he’s signed up again for piecemeal immigration reform. He opposed the Affordable Care Act but disappeared when Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas attempted to blow up the economy with C-4-laden green eggs and ham. Then he materialized again as an ardent foe of Obama just as the healthcare.gov website proved to have fewer working parts than the Senate itself. Now Rubio is against the Employment Nondiscrimination Act because . well, it prohibits employment discrimination? Really? Too hard? One day, Rubio, R-Boo! , will shuffle off this mortal coil. And what will be said of a man who once served in the United States Senate? Perhaps something along these lines. Marco Rubio once represented Florida in the United States Senate. He was a man who thought small and found no issue that couldn’t be reduced to the sum of its parts. He believed in a la carte governance. The senator was dedicated to furthering the one worthy cause he cared about — himself. He stood for nothing unless it was before the Iowa caucus. When called upon to lead, he ran away faster than the hapless knights in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. When the going got tough, he was on the next plane to New Hampshire. He gave good speeches and collected big checks. He staunchly opposed Fidel Castro. Yet he feared offending radio talk show hosts and the his tea party supporters. Rubio squandered his rare gift to do great things, to enhance the lives of people, to be remembered as a hard-working, bipartisan legislator because — it was too hard. He was a politician who took the easy way out.

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) NEW YORK - The sidewalk outside the subway station in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, was crowded on Tuesday morning. Bill de Blasio bent his 6-foot-5 frame again and again to shake hands. The spot had been chosen with care. It was here, in 1991, that New York City’s deep racial divide had exploded into three days of violence when de Blasio had been a low-level aide to Mayor David N. Dinkins. De Blasio’s opponent this year, Joseph J. Lhota, had pointed to that dark episode as a reason not to vote for him, as a warning of the bad times that were likely to return if he were elected. But there was no strife on Tuesday, no flying bottles. Just handshakes on the way to winning as de Blasio was welcomed as a hero and celebrity. “All I want to say is that I love you,” said a woman in jeans, a denim jacket and a paisley shawl. It was a note-perfect play in a campaign of them, summing up both his sharp political instincts and the changing feel of the city he wanted to run. On Tuesday, de Blasio was elected to become the first Democratic mayor of New York City in 20 years. Few had initially predicted his victory except, perhaps, the candidate himself. In high school, he was known by a nickname, Senator Provolone, and his classmates sometimes hummed “Hail to the Chief” when he entered the room. But throughout his life, de Blasio had come to delight in upsetting expectations. He overcame a troubled childhood and attended some of the country’s most prestigious universities. He married a black woman who once identified as a lesbian, Chirlane McCray, and created a proudly biracial home. He cut his teeth as a political operator but abandoned life as a strategist to make an audacious bid for public office himself. Now, as de Blasio, 52, prepares to become chief executive of one of the world’s largest cities, he will have a far grander stage on which to test the decidedly liberal world view that has been the hallmark of his career. On Tuesday, as de Blasio campaigned in Brooklyn, the centrality of his family to his personal and political life was clear. His daughter, Chiara, who is a college student in California, traveled home to surprise her father. She had told him she would not be able to return because of exams. “This is the greatest gift I could have on Election Day,” de Blasio told reporters. “I’m already floating on air because my daughter’s here with us.”", "event_args": [{"start": 16, "end": 22, "trigger": "HEADING", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 372, "end": 376, "trigger": "shake", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 515, "end": 522, "trigger": "violence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 437, "end": 440, "mention": "1991", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 775, "end": 781, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 724, "end": 725, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 801, "end": 806, "trigger": "strife", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 811, "end": 817, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 869, "end": 875, "trigger": "winning", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 894, "end": 901, "trigger": "welcomed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 968, "end": 971, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 962, "end": 964, "mention": "you", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 933, "end": 933, "mention": "I", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1207, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1178, "end": 1184, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1489, "trigger": "entered", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1372, "end": 1373, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1848, "trigger": "abandoned", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1795, "end": 1796, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1963, "trigger": "become", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2330, "end": 2337, "trigger": "traveled", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2339, "end": 2342, "mention": "home", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2379, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2368, "end": 2370, "mention": "She", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 2381, "end": 2383, "mention": "him", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2410, "end": 2415, "trigger": "return", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2385, "end": 2387, "mention": "she", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2503, "end": 2506, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2508, "end": 2516, "mention": "reporters", "role": "entity"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131108.0148", "document": "METAL EXCHANGE CHANGES RULES TO TRIM WAIT TIMES ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling: 1-888-603-1036 or 1-888-346-9867.) Hoping to reduce the warehouse delays that have added billions of dollars to the prices that consumers pay for beverage cans and other aluminum products, the London Metals Exchange has released new regulations meant to reduce the waiting times at storage facilities owned by commodities traders and banks like Goldman Sachs. Beer breweries and other businesses that buy aluminum have for years complained that Metro International Trade Services, a string of Detroit-area warehouses owned by Goldman Sachs, had orchestrated bottlenecks at its facilities that forced them to wait as long as 16 months for their metal to be delivered. The delays have generated millions in profits for the warehouse, which charges rent by the day. But they also add to the storage expense for aluminum buyers, costs that are passed on to consumers. Because of a quirk in the way metal prices are set on the spot market, the delays raise the price of nearly all the aluminum sold in the United States, even if the metal is never stored in a warehouse. The new guidelines, released Wednesday after a three-month review of the aluminum storage business, will require warehouses with waiting times of 50 days or longer to load out more metal than they take in each day. The exchange, which is owned by investors and regulates 700 storage facilities around the globe, said it would also be more aggressive in investigating instances where warehouses appeared to be instigating the delays. “The LME will now have a greater power to investigate and to act to prevent warehouse companies unreasonably incentivizing the formation of queues,” Garry Jones, the exchange’s chief executive, said in a video announcing the changes. Beverage makers and aluminum brokers offered measured praise for the new regulations. Some aluminum brokers and users had urged the exchange to forbid warehouses from charging rent during any delivery delays. But the report said that that suggestion, while attractive, might lead warehouse owners to raise other fees, so the exchange would consider it as a “next step” option if its current reforms failed to shorten the lines. Nick Madden, the head of procurement at Novelis, said he was optimistic that the changes would help address the issue. But the Beer Institute, which lobbied Congress and federal regulators, said more needed to be done. The rule changes “are a move in the right direction, but we believe further reforms could be immediately implemented to return the LME to a proper, free-market function of global aluminum price discovery,” a spokeswoman for institute said in a statement. The Federal Reserve is reviewing the exemptions that allow Goldman and other banks to own commodities storage facilities. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman, said Thursday that the company had no comment on the new regulation. But Goldman officials have repeatedly denied accusations that they intentionally caused the delays. Company officials have cited a variety of causes for the bottlenecks over the years, including a shortage of trucks and forklift drivers and the logistical challenges of locating and moving 1,500-pound bars of aluminum stacked 15 feet high in cavernous storage facilities. After a congressional hearing in July, at which several senators called on Goldman and other investment banks to divest themselves of their commodities holdings, Gary Cohn, the Goldman president, said that Metro would offer immediate delivery to any metal owners who requested it. But the report released Wednesday by the metal exchange - based on meetings with more than 70 participants in the aluminum industry - found that stronger measures were needed to ease the backlog at Metro and a handful of other warehouses with long waiting times.", "event_args": [{"start": 6, "end": 13, "trigger": "EXCHANGE", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 72, "end": 75, "trigger":

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131113.0045", "document": "THREE JOURNALISTS AT THE TIMES ARE DEPARTING EDS: SUBS for writethru to reflect developments; NEW headline.) Three journalists at The New York Times on Tuesday announced plans to leave the newspaper. Hugo Lindgren, editor of The New York Times Magazine, told his staff in a brief meeting Tuesday afternoon that he would leave The Times at year’s end. Lindgren was hired by The Times in September 2010 after working as executive editor of Bloomberg Businessweek. No successor has been named, a spokeswoman for The Times said. Responding to a request for comment, Lindgren wrote in an email: “I loved editing The Times Magazine over the course of 150-plus issues. Looking forward to the next challenge.” Also Tuesday, CNN announced that it had hired Brian Stelter, a media reporter at The Times, to host its weekly news show “Reliable Sources.” The network said that Stelter, 28, would also be a senior media correspondent, reporting on “trends, personalities and companies across the media spectrum.” “I’m equally excited about reporting throughout the week on CNN’s many digital platforms and television networks,” Stelter, who joined The Times in 2007, said in a statement. “CNN is reimagining media coverage at what is the best time ever to be covering media, and I’m very happy to be a part of it.” In addition, Matt Bai, a political correspondent for The New York Times Magazine, said he was joining Yahoo News as its national political columnist. Bai, 45, said in an email that he planned to start at Yahoo in December, probably writing a weekly column “with some additional columns added on big news days.” “It’s just such a chaotic moment in journalism, and here was a chance to work for a digital entity that combines vast resources and just this vast readership,” he wrote. “I found that really compelling.” The departures follow moves last month by several other well-known Times employees, all of whom were leaving to join digital companies. Richard L. Berke, a longtime political correspondent and senior editor, left for Politico. Howard Beck, an NBA beat reporter, joined Bleacher Report, and David Pogue, a longtime technology columnist, also announced he was joining Yahoo. Nate Silver, whose FiveThirtyEight blog was licensed by The Times in 2010, joined ESPN in the summer.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131210.0244", "document": "U.N. TO DELIVER AID TO SYRIA VIA IRAQ GENEVA - U.N. relief agencies are preparing to make their first deliveries of aid from Iraq to Syria this week but it remains unclear whether this will prove a regular channel of assistance, the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday. An airlift of 12 flights using Russian-built Ilyushin cargo aircraft is to start Thursday and last until Sunday delivering food and other assistance from Iraq to Kurdish areas of Syria’s northeastern Hassakeh province, according to Amin Awad, the director of the Middle East and North Africa bureau at the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Relief agencies believe there are 50,000 to 60,000 people in need of assistance in Hassakeh, where conflict has obstructed access by humanitarian agencies. “It’s certainly a welcome development for us, the humanitarian conditions there are getting worse,” said Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the refugee agency, citing U.N. estimates that 6.5 million people inside Syria have been driven from their homes by fighting. In addition to the security challenges in delivering assistance to areas of conflict, international aid agencies have complained of bureaucratic obstacles and delays from the government in Damascus in obtaining approval for relief convoys destined for populations trapped by fighting, and the agencies have pushed for more cross-border access from neighboring countries. The high commissioner for refugees, António Guterres, is to meet Anne Richard, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for population, refugees, and migration, and officials from aid agencies in Geneva on Wednesday at the start of a two-day meeting.

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) WASHINGTON - In the minutes before Asiana Airlines flight 214 crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6, 1 of the 3 pilots in the cockpit called out three times that the plane was descending too fast. But none of the pilots noticed that they were flying the plane too slowly until shortly before it hit the sea wall at the end of runway 28 Left. Documents released Wednesday by the National Transportation Safety Board, which held a daylong hearing on the crash, show that inexperience and Korean culture played a role in the way the pilots handled the landing. The captain, Lee Kang Kuk, who was flying the plane, told investigators that any of the three pilots could have decided to break off the approach, but for “the low-level people,” including himself because he was being supervised by an instructor pilot, “it’s very hard,” he said. He also said that as the plane approached he was momentarily blinded by a bright light on the runway, possibly a reflection of the sun, but that he would not wear sunglasses because among Koreans that would be impolite. The documents indicated that there was confusion among the crew about how the Boeing 777’s auto throttles worked. Lee had just 35 hours experience in that model, and in an interview with investigators he appeared to have confused some details of the automation system with that of the Airbus A320, with which he had extensive experience. The first mention that the plane was descending too fast came about a minute before impact, in English, which the crew was using on approach, according to a transcript of the flight data recorder. The second mention was also in English, but the third, about nine seconds after the first, was in Korean, a clue in the transcript about the intensity of the comment. No one said the plane was too low until the last 30 seconds of the flight. Three seconds before impact, Lee made a comment indicating an attempt to re-engage the engines and abort the approach. The plane was then at an altitude of less than 30 feet. The 777 hit the sea wall, breaking off the back of the fuselage. Despite a dramatic cartwheel and then a cloud of dust and smoke, only three passengers died.", "event_args": [{"start": 338, "end": 347, "trigger": "called out", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 556, "end": 563, "trigger": "released", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 565, "end": 573, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 815, "end": 818, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 789, "end": 791, "mention": "who", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1442, "trigger": "interview", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1449, "end": 1461, "mention": "investigators", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1378, "mention": "Lee", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2085, "trigger": "comment", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2068, "end": 2070, "mention": "Lee", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2366, "end": 2369, "trigger": "died", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131221.0217", "document": "BLACKBERRY STAGGERS TO A DEEPER, $4.4 BILLION LOSS EDS: SUBS for complete writethru; NEW headline.) ; (This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) OTTAWA, Ontario - BlackBerry, the hobbled smartphone maker, reported more dire financial news Friday, posting a $4.4 billion loss and a 56 percent drop in revenue in its latest quarter. The company also outlined a sharp retreat from its once-core handset business by entering a partnership with the Asian contract manufacturer Foxconn. The substantial loss, which follows one of nearly $1 billion in the previous quarter, again reflected the failure of the BlackBerry 10 line of phones, which were portrayed as a lifesaver for the company when introduced at the beginning of the year. The latest loss included a $2.7 billion write-down mainly related to BlackBerry 10 phones, including the Q10 and the Z10. Of the 4.3 million BlackBerrys bought by consumers and businesses during the quarter, 3.2 million were models that use the obsolete BlackBerry 7 operating system. The meager sales of the phone led revenue to plunge to $1.2 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the same period a year ago. Last month, BlackBerry failed to find a buyer for the company and replaced Thorsten Heins, the chief executive, with John S. Chen, the former chairman of the software company Sybase. Chen has since fired several high-level executives at the company. But the first real strategic change under Chen came Friday, when he announced the company’s arrangement with Foxconn. BlackBerry, like other many other hardware companies including Apple, has long relied on Foxconn to manufacture phones. The new partnership appears to take the relationship to a new level. The arrangement also seems to be a way for BlackBerry to effectively hand over some of its handset business without running afoul of Canadian foreign investment laws. In a conference call with analysts, Chen said that BlackBerry would jointly develop and manufacture some phones with Foxconn. Because Foxconn will carry the inventory of those phones on its books, Chen said that BlackBerry would be shielded from large writedowns of unwanted handsets in the future. In what seemed to be an even further distancing from the company’s past, Chen was remarkably open to the idea of joining the competition. “I would love to find a way to make our BlackBerry experience on the Android and the iOS,” he said, referring to the two dominant mobile operating systems. “It’s not without difficulties, as you all know. But it’s something that we’re very interested in trying.”", "event_args": [{"start": 280, "end": 284, "trigger": "maker", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 269, "end": 278, "mention": "smartphone", "role": "artifact"}]}, {"start": 287, "end": 294, "trigger": "reported", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 321, "end": 326, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 382, "end": 388, "trigger": "revenue", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 321, "end": 326, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 245, "end": 254, "mention": "BlackBerry", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 541, "end": 552, "trigger": "manufacturer", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 965, "end": 970, "trigger": "bought", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 975, "end": 983, "mention": "consumers", "role": "recipient"}, {"start": 989, "end": 998, "mention": "businesses", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1112, "trigger": "sales", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1137, "trigger": "revenue", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1268, "trigger": "buyer", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1236, "end": 1245, "mention": "BlackBerry", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1297, "trigger": "replaced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1236, "end": 1245, "mention": "BlackBerry", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1364, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1366, "end": 1373, "mention": "chairman", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1426, "trigger": "fired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1407, "end": 1410, "mention": "Chen", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1550, "trigger": "announced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1526, "end": 1531, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1480, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1692, "end": 1702, "trigger": "manufacture", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1704, "end": 1709, "mention": "phones", "role": "artifact"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1687, "mention": "Foxconn", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1858, "trigger": "hand over", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1824, "end": 1833, "mention": "BlackBerry", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1940, "trigger": "investment", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1824, "end": 1833, "mention": "BlackBerry", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1962, "trigger": "conference", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1974, "end": 1981, "mention": "analysts", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1984, "end": 1987, "mention": "Chen", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1964, "end": 1967, "trigger": "call", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1974, "end": 1981, "mention": "analysts", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1984, "end": 1987, "mention": "Chen", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2024, "end": 2030, "trigger": "develop", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2065, "end": 2071, "mention": "Foxconn", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2008, "mention": "BlackBerry", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2046, "trigger": "manufacture", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1999, "end": 2008, "mention": "BlackBerry", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2071, "mention": "Foxconn", "role": "agent"}]}]}
