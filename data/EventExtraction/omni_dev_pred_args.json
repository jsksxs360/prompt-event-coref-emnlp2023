{"doc_id": "14fbeb82a73a7df37bcda0583c9bca7e", "document": "The \"punishment\" of Fayhan al Ghamdi for viciously beating, raping and burning his innocent 5 year old daughter who this sick and twisted man suspected of not being a virgin... a fifty thousand dollar fine and time served... is an offense to God and every decent human being alike. It is also an extreme hypocrisy that in Saudi Arabia, a man cannot be executed for killing his children or wife, but can face the death penalty for leaving Islam and becoming a Christian (or a member of any other religion). The World Muslim Congress came out with a statement decrying both the murder and the \"punishment\" (if it can be called that). While I do not agree with them that the Quran is God's word or that Muhammad is his prophet, everything else they said regarding the case is dead-on, in my opinion. I agree with them that capital punishment is wrong, albeit not only for the reasons they gave (which I think are good ones) but also because God clearly said in the Bible that those who do not show mercy will not be shown mercy by God. The Saudi rapist Fayhan al-Ghamdi, got away with murder The intention of Sharia law was to serve justice to the parties in conflict, it is human interpretation of God's word to suit their era, it is not a divine law, neither is it God's law as propagated. However, it is the abuse in administering the Sharia law that is the problem. Unfortunately, the Sharia law is so distorted that it sounds like a cruel system of law to a woman who gets thrown out on the whim of an idiot by calling Talaq three times, female rape victim, an apostate and the blasphemer. Those men you have listed, \"Imam Hanifa, Imam Shafi, Imam Hanbal, Imam Malik, Imam Ghazali or Imam Madoodi,\" were great men with a few exceptions for their time. They defined the Sharia in terms of the norms prevalent at that time. With all due respect and honor for their work, they did not have the same environment as Prophet Muhammad did or we have, - of working with different tribes and faiths, and as a result their attitudes were \"stick it to them\". This man, Fayhan al-Ghamdi got away paying the blood money. He should have been locked away, as they say in Urdu \"Qaid ba-mushaqqat\" prison with hard labor. What prevents the SOB from repeating it? If he has the money to shell out again, he will do it again. I n the US there are many incidents where a hard core criminal was let out on bail, and he would do go out and do the same. I am personally against the state killing the criminal deliberately, it denies the criminal from living the life, and prevents him from repenting his mistake.... and the blood money does not bring justice, compensation should be there to the victims, but that should be a part of whole punishment. We cannot trade life for money. Only God's word is beyond question, Prophet's words, if genuine, would be unquestionable. A lot has been dished out as Prophet's word. I come across so much non-sense ascribed to him. He was the ultimate peace maker and rightfully called Rahmatul Aalameen -the mercy to mankind. Muslims do not uphold that title for him; they are brutal towards those who convert from Islam to other faiths, or blasphemers. Some Muslims are very insecure in their faith, they think that Prophet will disappear into thin air if someone criticizes him, or not defended. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is beyond defending. Some of the Imams did not have faith in the prophet and resorted to defending him, how wrong are they! Be hopeful, things will change for better, the new generation will restore common sense to the religion which is about fairness, justness and respect for God's creation. Islam is about freedom and not compulsion.

Only about 34 percent of Rios sewage is treated, and the rest simply washes into the azure waters, giving new meaning to the nautical term poop deck. Guanabara Bay, the site of several 2016 Olympic sailing events, has 78 times Brazils legally allowed limit of fecal pollution, and 195 times the U.S. limit. In addition to human waste, the bay is also a receptacle for trash from ships and the bay's 15 adjacent communities, as well as toxic runoff from a former landfill. And its not just Guanabarathe ritzy Leblon and Ipanema beach areas are plagued with similar pollution problems. The state environmental agency, INEA, found that Leblon and Ipanema were unfit for swimming for 40 percent of 2011.

A court in Hungary has sentenced him to five and a half years in prison. The once-eminent pro-Soviet functionary is responsible, according to the indictment, for the death of dozens of Hungarians shot dead during the anti-Communist and anti-Soviet uprising in 1956. Biszku was found guilty today of other crimes, including denying the crimes committed during the communist regime. In Hungary denial of the crimes of communism and Holocaust denial are felonies. The former politician may now appeal the verdict. Biszku is alleged to have been a member of a commission that ordered the killing of civilians during the protests of 1956. His trial began in mid-March and has attracted a great deal of attention in the Hungarian media. The ex-minister was able to be convicted on the basis of a law promoted and enforced by the conservative Fidesz party of current Prime Minister Viktor Orbán that says the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity are not subject to time limitations. Several thousand people died during the anti-Communist uprising in Hungary in 1956. The revolt was drowned in blood by a Soviet Army military intervention. During the subsequent purges more than 200 people were executed, 22 000 ended up in prison, and 210 00 emigrated.

Was unreal, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I even asked the man nicely \" How can someone with Multiple Sclerosis NOT file for insurance when my medication alone cost about $13,000 a year.\" He didn't comment. So from there we changed our spring wedding to November, a really small wedding to get insurance for me faster. Alot of people must have been praying for me since my M.S. hasn't been too bad except for when I was ill in August/September. I'm really happy to have insurance, I can get my MRIs done, since I am in Massachusetts now I can go to UMass Hospital which has some of the best Neurologists ( My Neurologist from Connecticut told me this ), get started on medication again. Today I'm feeling ok. My job is bothering me a bit, but I'll get over it. Next week I start working 6 days a week, about 50 hours. I work for Cingular Wireless and they told me Holiday is the craziest time of the year                                                                    This is my first Christmas working for the company so hopefully all will go well... I know as soon as I get home starting next week I'll most likely just fall                                                                     .... It's going to be hard because I won't see my husband much.... I now have to work on Sundays for the next 7 weeks so I wont be able to go to church or see him... My only day off will be Monday, and his Wednesday. Just have to keep alot of prayer                                                                      , and keep rejoicing                                                                    ... Well it's Saturday!!! Here at work until 7.... Snow is everywhere, snowed yeserday until this morning, got a good 4 inches!!! I can't believe it. It's almost 2005 already, where has time gone... I'm looking foward to warm weather already and I have to wait about 5 months to see it!! lol. The Lord protected me this morning... I was driving to work, and hit the brakes too much instead of downshifting and lowering my RPMs, and spun out, I didn't hit anyone thankfully just went into a driveway... PHEW                                                                       What a blessing that was since it's a busy road. Hallelujah, Hallelujah May everything about me be Hallelujah to my King. - Lyrics from Sarah Kelly. Well it's another Sunday and I'm here at work again! Only 5 more Sundays and I'm back to having my Sunday-Monday days off again. It's been a crazy week so far, my husband and I are thinking about leaving the crazy weather of Northeast region to move to Florida. I know, Florida!!!! I have never even been to Florida, lol. It's looking pretty positive right now, but he insists that he wants to buy a house, and I want an apartment. He's also going to allow me to work part time, and I can go back to college. God bless him. We told some friends last night, but I only told my auntie about this, no one in our family knows at all. I'm very nervous/scared to live in Florida, seeing that I lived in Connecticut all my life until September of this year when I moved to Massachusetts. His mom is probably not going to take it too well if we decide to go to Florida, she's already pretty upset that his other 2 brother already been living in New Hampshire with their wives for sometime now, and she thought her youngest was going to stay closeby in Massachusetts. Florida will be different if we go... It's looking pretty positive of going. We just got to finish paying off his debt, and go from there... I pray that the Lord will guide us in the right direction. If we were to go to Florida I pray the Lord directs us to a good church.", "event_args": [{"start": 14, "end": 20, "trigger": "married", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 5, "end": 5, "mention": "I", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 31, "end": 37, "trigger": "married", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 5, "end": 5, "mention": "I", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 91, "end": 94, "trigger": "this", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 74, "end": 74, "mention": "I", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 140, "end": 146, "trigger": "started", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 74, "end": 74, "mention": "I", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 313, "end": 316, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 166, "end": 167, "mention": "my", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 540, "end": 543, "trigger": "cost", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 520, "end": 521, "mention": "my", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 623, "end": 629, "trigger": "wedding", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 612, "end": 614, "mention": "our", "role": "person"}, {"start": 634, "end": 641, "mention": "November", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 659, "end": 665, "trigger": "wedding", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 612, "end": 614, "mention": "our", "role": "person"}, {"start": 634, "end": 641, "mention": "November", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 923, "end": 924, "trigger": "go", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 825, "end": 825, "mention": "I", "role": "person"}, {"start": 899, "end": 911, "mention": "Massachusetts", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1463, "trigger": "get home", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1198, "end": 1198, "mention": "I", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1463, "mention": "home", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1719, "trigger": "go", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1646, "end": 1646, "mention": "I", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1729, "mention": "church", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 2323, "end": 2329, "trigger": "driving", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2334, "end": 2337, "mention": "work", "role": "destination"}, {"start": 2317, "end": 2317, "mention": "I", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2464, "end": 2467, "trigger": "went", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2317, "end": 2317, "mention": "I", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 2911, "end": 2917, "trigger": "leaving", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2844, "end": 2844, "mention": "I", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2960, "end": 2963, "trigger": "move", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2968, "end": 2974, "mention": "Florida", "role": "destination"}, {"start": 2844, "end": 2844, "mention": "I", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 3015, "end": 3018, "trigger": "been", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3023, "end": 3029, "mention": "Florida", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 3109, "end": 3111, "trigger": "buy", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3081, "end": 3082, "mention": "he", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 3472, "end": 3476, "trigger": "moved", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3345, "end": 3345, "mention": "I", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 3481, "end": 3493, "mention": "Massachusetts", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 3562, "end": 3563, "trigger": "go", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3541, "end": 3542, "mention": "we", "role": "person"}, {"start": 3568, "end": 3574, "mention": "Florida", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 3806, "end": 3807, "trigger": "go", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3803, "end": 3804, "mention": "we", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 3774, "end": 3780, "mention": "Florida", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 3873, "end": 3882, "trigger": "paying off", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3851, "end": 3852, "mention": "We", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 3988, "end": 3989, "trigger": "go", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3977, "end": 3978, "mention": "we", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 3994, "end": 4000, "mention": "Florida", "role": "destination"}]}]}

A Maryland teacher has been convicted of lending aid to a Pakistani terrorist organization. The conviction of 29-year-old Ali Asad Chandia is the government's 11th conviction in its investigation of what it called a \"Virginia jihad network\" that used paintball games to train for global holy war. Chandia, a third-grade teacher at a Muslim school in College Park, was convicted on three of the four counts he faced, including providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization and conspiracy to do the same. The government says that Chandia traveled to Pakistan after the September Eleventh attacks and received military training from a group called Lashkar-e-Taiba That group is fighting for Muslim control over the disputed Kashmir region on the India-Pakistan border. Chandia faces a maximum of 45 years in prison when he is sentenced in August. Copyright 2006 Associated Press.

Prosecutors had sought a sentence of 30 years to life in prison for Ali Asad Chandia, 29, one of the 11 Muslim men charged in US District Court in Alexandria in June 2003 with training with and fighting for Lashkar-e-Taiba. Chandia, they said, trained at a Lashkar camp in Pakistan and helped the group acquire paintballs and other equipment with potential military applications when he returned to the United States. The equipment included unmanned aerial vehicles, night-vision equipment and wireless video cameras. Federal investigators also found a CD-ROM in Chandia's car containing videos that glorified Osama bin Laden and the 19 hijackers who carried out the Sep 11 attacks, prosecutors said. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria did not explain his reasoning as he imposed the sentence and ordered Chandia, who had been free on bond, into custody. Earlier, Chandia, who teaches at a Muslim school in Maryland, had told the judge that he did not \"deserve to spend a single day in prison.\" With his voice shaking and rising in anger, Chandia said: \"With Allah as my witness, I tell everyone that I am innocent... God knows that I did not support and would not support any terrorists.\" Chandia's sentencing wrapped up an investigation that has produced more guilty verdicts than any domestic terrorism case in US since the attacks of Sep 11, 2001. Six of the 11 men pleaded guilty, three were convicted at trial and two were acquitted. The group's spiritual leader, Ali al-Timimi, was convicted last year on charges that included soliciting others to levy war against the United States and contributing services to Afghanistan's former Taliban rulers. He was sentenced to life in prison. The Justice Department has hailed the case as key to the domestic campaign against terrorism, saying that its post-Sept 11 mandate is to prevent attacks. A federal jury convicted Chandia in June of three counts of providing material support to Lashkar-e-Taiba or conspiring to do so and acquitted him on a fourth count of supporting terrorists. The evidence at trial established that during a three-month trip to Pakistan in 2001-2002, Chandia met and allied himself with Mohammed Ajmal Khan, a British citizen of Pakistani descent. Khan, who is currently serving a nine-year sentence in the United Kingdom for directing a terrorist organisation, served as a military procurement official for Lashkar-e-Taiba. Chandia assisted Khan in procuring military-purpose equipment for Lashkar-e-Taiba for use in its violent jihad against India. He gave safe harbour to Khan during Khan's visits to the United States in 2002 and 2003, and allowed Khan to use his home computer to pursue the acquisition of equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles, night-vision equipment and wireless video cameras. Khan also used the defendant's computer to confirm the purchase of $17,000 of Kevlar anti-ballistic material that Khan had purchased for Lashkar-e-Taiba. In a search of Chandia's home conducted on May 8, 2003, the FBI found audiotapes and other materials manifesting his commitment to violent jihad. On the front seat of Chandia's car, the FBI also found a CD-ROM containing videos glorifying the Sep 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Osama bin Laden and the 19 hijackers who carried out the attacks. They also found a CD-ROM containing still photographs of persons jumping to their deaths from the World Trade Center towers. \"Terrorist organisations like Lashkar-e-Taiba rely on a network of individuals to carry out their deadly operations,\" US Attorney Rosenberg said after the sentencing. \"Ali Asad Chandia was a member of that network for Lashkar-e-Taiba, and he will now spend a very long period of time in prison for providing material support in furtherance of its violent agenda,\" he added.

Today, MetroPCS announced that the DOJ has allowed the waiting period to lapse on the planned merger between the two companies. The waiting period was required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. This indicates that the DOJ doesn't have any objections to the merger. There are still other regulatory approvals the companies must get in order to close the deal. The Federal Communications Commission must approve the transfer of spectrum licenses. There has been some opposition to the merger, including some pushback from labor unions that contend the merger will put jobs in jeopardy. After stating that the merger would create jobs, T-Mobile and MetroPCS recently filed a statement with the FCC admitting that there would be job losses. But the companies said the job losses would be minimal. The companies also need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment, since T-Mobile is a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, a German telecommunications company.

Now, the selection of Ryan, only the second Catholic ever nominated for national office by Republicans, all but guarantees a fierce election-year fight for the affections of Catholic voters  or more specifically, whiteCatholics, who form the bulk of the Catholic vote here in this corner of Iowa and across the Rust Belt. Four years ago, there wasnt much of a fight. President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics, about a quarter of the electorate, by what the exit polls showed was an 18-percentage-point margin.

During his interrogation, Kasab confessed that the ten terrorists, including himself, who attacked Mumbai received training of swimming and underwater diving from the Pakistan Navy's frogmen. A frogman is someone who is trained to dive, swim and combat. \"The role of frogmen was confirmed by Headley when the Indian investigators interrogated him in the US last month,\" an official said. This is being seen as another clear indicator of the Pakistani establishment's involvement in the planning and execution of the Mumbai terror attack, which claimed 168 lives. Home secretary Gopal K Pillai had recently said that the ISI was \"literally controlling and coordinating the (Mumbai) attack from beginning to end\". Pakistani-American Headley, currently in American custody, was interrogated by a team of National Investigation Agency. Officials said that the Indian investigators so far have no plan to interrogate Headley's accomplice Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a Pakistani origin Canadian citizen, as his involvement in the Mumbai attack conspiracy was limited to providing finance. \"If necessary we may interrogate Rana also, though we have no immediate plan to do so,\" an official said. Headley has also told his interrogators that the Pakistani intelligence agency had paid Rs 25 lakh to LeT to purchase a boat which terrorists used to travel from Karachi to the Pakistani maritime boundary, where they hijacked an Indian fishing boat 'Kuber' to reach Mumbai. Headley also identified through voice sample test two ISI officers believed to be constant contact with the terrorists who carried out the 60-hour attack in Mumbai on November 26, 2008. Officials said Indian investigators have information that ISI chief Lieutenant General Ahmed Shuja Pasha had met one of the handlers of the Mumbai attack, Sajjid Mir, who is currently in a Pakistani jail. \"All this information have been shared by India with Pakistan through the multiple dossiers given to it,\" the official said. \"All this information have been shared by India with Pakistan through the multiple dossiers given to it,\" the official said.

Hu was speaking Monday as he toured a Beijing exhibit on transport and building safety with a group of schoolchildren on the eve of International Children's Day, the report said. His remarks come after a spate of bloody school attacks around China since late March which have left 17 people dead, including 15 students, and scores injured. Experts say the senseless assaults reveal a China struggling to come to grips with rapid social change following decades of booming economic growth. On Sunday, a 47-year-old unemployed man was executed for carrying out an assault on 32 people, mostly small children, at a kindergarten in eastern China in April. The man, Xu Yuyuan, wielded a knife usually used to slaughter pigs. Xu, who was sentenced to death on May 15, told the court his motive was to vent his rage against society after losing money gambling and in business dealings, and suffering setbacks in his personal life. In late April, a former doctor who stabbed eight schoolchildren to death in a March school attack was executed. Two other school assailants have committed suicide. Premier Wen Jiabao said last month that long-standing social concerns including joblessness and a gaping rich-poor divide were partially to blame for the string of attacks. \"We need to resolve the deep-seated causes that have resulted in these problems,\" Wen said in an interview with Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television. \"This includes handling social contradictions, resolving disputes and strengthening mediation at the grassroots level.\"", "event_args": [{"start": 48, "end": 55, "trigger": "killings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 41, "end": 46, "mention": "school", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 89, "end": 94, "trigger": "called", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 174, "end": 177, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 179, "end": 185, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 237, "end": 244, "trigger": "killings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 230, "end": 235, "mention": "school", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 448, "end": 453, "trigger": "toured", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 435, "end": 440, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 419, "end": 420, "mention": "Hu", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 646, "end": 652, "trigger": "attacks", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 639, "end": 644, "mention": "school", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 710, "end": 713, "trigger": "dead", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 639, "end": 644, "mention": "school", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 750, "end": 756, "trigger": "injured", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 743, "end": 748, "mention": "scores", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 952, "end": 959, "trigger": "executed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 911, "end": 916, "mention": "Sunday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 981, "end": 987, "trigger": "assault", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "mention": "April", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1097, "trigger": "wielded", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1159, "trigger": "sentenced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1143, "end": 1145, "mention": "who", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1184, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1143, "end": 1145, "mention": "who", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1255, "trigger": "losing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1196, "end": 1198, "mention": "his", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1384, "trigger": "stabbed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1414, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1439, "trigger": "attack", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1421, "end": 1425, "mention": "March", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1452, "trigger": "executed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1421, "end": 1425, "mention": "March", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1397, "mention": "school", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1481, "trigger": "assailants", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1504, "trigger": "suicide", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1529, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1777, "end": 1785, "trigger": "interview", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1762, "end": 1764, "mention": "Wen", "role": "entity"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "APW_ENG_20090611.0697", "document": "Gadhafi attacks US in speech in Italy Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Thursday urged the world to understand what motivates terrorists, and likened the 1986 U.S. strikes on Libya to Osama bin Laden's terror attacks. Gadhafi, who was long accused of sponsoring terrorism, got tepid applause from the Italian lawmakers he addressed on the second day of a trip to Italy, Libya's former colonial ruler. \"It is not very intelligent to chase terrorists down the Afghan mountains or central Asia,\" Gadhafi said in the hour-long speech. \"That's impossible. We must look at their reasons. He called for dialogue with terrorists, saying, \"One must talk to the devil, if it brings about a solution.\" Sarcastically, he asked, \"What's the difference between the U.S. airstrikes on our homes and bin Laden's actions?\" If anything, he said, bin Laden is an outlaw, while the United States is a country that should abide by international law. Former President Ronald Reagan ordered airstrikes on Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986 after an attack on a disco in Germany killed three people, including two U.S. servicemen. The Libyans say the retaliatory attacks killed 41 people, including Gadhafi's adopted daughter, and injured 226 others. The Libyan leader told the lawmakers he was being intentionally provocative \"in order to try and understand acts of terrorism.\" Gadhafi had long been ostracized by the West for sponsoring terrorism, but in recent years sought to emerge from his pariah status by abandoning weapons of mass destruction and renouncing terrorism in 2003. Libya has since agreed to pay compensation to the families of the Berlin disco victims as well as the families of the victims of the 1988 Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people, including 189 Americans. Libyan Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi was convicted of blowing up the plane. The United States restored diplomatic ties with Libya in 2006 and removed the North African nation from the State Department list of countries that sponsor terrorism. Gadhafi's visit to Italy continued that process of emergence from international isolation. But it also drew protests, including at La Sapienza university, where Gadhafi was addressing a group of few hundred students. The speech to lawmakers was likely to raise more controversy. He had been set to speak inside the Italian Senate, a rare honor for visiting dignitaries. But opposition lawmakers balked, forcing the speech to be moved to a palazzo next door. Enrico Morando, a senator of the opposition Democratic Party, said Gadhafi's presence at the Senate would have been a \"humiliation of this country's democratic and republican spirit.\" \"Only those who have the credentials _ in terms of democracy and protection of human rights _ are entitled to speak to Parliament, the inviolable temple of democracy,\" he told La Repubblica newspaper. Human rights organizations and other critics have also denounced a recent deal that allows Italy to send immigrants back to Libya if they are intercepted at sea. They also decried Libya's treatment of the migrants and its poor human rights record.", "event_args": [{"start": 22, "end": 27, "trigger": "speech", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 32, "end":

{"doc_id": "APW_ENG_20101231.0037", "document": "Protests intensify in Bolivia over gasoline prices Protests against a sharp increase in fuel prices intensified and turned violent in Bolivia on Thursday, as thousands of demonstrators demanded President Evo Morales' government repeal the hike. Demonstrators filled the streets in La Paz and other cities to protest the higher prices, which were announced suddenly on Sunday, prompting an immediate 73 percent jump in gasoline prices and an 83 percent rise in prices for diesel. It also led to rapid increases in transport and food prices in the Andean country. Some demanded the resignation of Morales, a close ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. It has been the most unpopular measure of Morales' five-year presidency. Taxi drivers held a strike that largely paralyzed La Paz on Thursday, and protests were also held in the cities of Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Potosi and Oruro. The march in the capital began peacefully but clashes with police erupted when demonstrators tried to enter the main plaza where the government palace is located. Police used tear gas to disperse the protesters, who hurled stones at officers, the vice president's office, a union headquarters and two ministry buildings. In El Alto, neighboring the capital, demonstrators set afire a car and toll booths. People lined a bridge while protesters raised fists demanding the measure be repealed. Interior Minister Sacha Llorenti said disturbances in La Paz, El Alto and Cochabamba left 15 police officers injured, two seriously. A group of protesters burned a Venezuelan flag. \"We make a call for calm, for tranquility; there are police on patrol to guarantee security,\" Llorenti told a news conference. Fuel prices had been frozen for six years, but the government said it could no longer afford to subsidize them, especially since much is smuggled across the border to neighboring countries. Responding to the protests, Morales' government has announced steps aimed at mitigating the economic effects _ including 20 percent salary increases for public workers aimed at offsetting higher fuel prices. The government also announced new assistance to rice, corn and wheat farmers intended to increase production and bring down prices. Demonstrators have called their protest the \"gasolinazo.\" Neighborhood protest leader Claudio Luna said in La Paz that the government's \"message hasn't met the expectations of the population, and for that reason we're going to continue the protests.\" He said demonstrators want prices lowered back to their former levels. Bus drivers have also held sporadic protests this week, demanding the government further increase fares. Authorities ordered raises of 60 to 80 percent in public transport fares, but bus drivers argue that isn't enough to offset the higher costs. Food prices have also risen 15 percent in subsidized government markets, but that remained much less than in private supermarkets. People seeking bargains lined up at a state-run food store in La Paz on Thursday. Morales, meanwhile, said in a news conference that he is inviting advisers from Paraguay's government to help formulate additional measures to lessen the blow of eliminating fuel subsidies.", "event_args": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "trigger": "Protests", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 22, "end": 28, "mention": "Bolivia", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 51, "end": 58, "trigger": "Protests", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 145, "end": 152, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 134, "end": 140, "mention": "Bolivia", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 259, "end": 264, "trigger": "filled", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 245, "end": 257, "mention": "Demonstrators", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 346, "end": 354, "trigger": "announced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 368, "end": 373, "mention": "Sunday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 580, "end": 590, "trigger": "resignation", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 595, "end": 601, "mention": "Morales", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 747, "end": 752, "trigger": "strike", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 787, "end": 794, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 801, "end": 808, "trigger": "protests", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 866, "end": 871, "mention": "Potosi", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 888, "end": 892, "trigger": "march", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 930, "end": 936, "trigger": "clashes", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 986, "end": 990, "trigger": "enter", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 943, "end": 948, "mention": "police", "role": "attacker"}, {"start": 963, "end": 975, "mention": "demonstrators", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1057, "trigger": "used", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1047, "end": 1052, "mention": "Police", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1078, "trigger": "disperse", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1047, "end": 1052, "mention": "Police", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1105, "trigger": "hurled", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1047, "end": 1052, "mention": "Police", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1264, "trigger": "afire", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1242, "end": 1254, "mention": "demonstrators", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1333, "trigger": "raised", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1317, "end": 1326, "mention": "protesters", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1412, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1425, "trigger": "disturbances", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1485, "end": 1491, "trigger": "injured", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1450, "end": 1459, "mention": "Cochabamba", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1536, "trigger": "burned", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1620, "end": 1625, "trigger": "patrol", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1610, "end": 1615, "mention": "police", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1663, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1651, "end": 1658, "mention": "Llorenti", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1788, "trigger": "subsidize", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1751, "end": 1752, "mention": "it", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1821, "end": 1828, "trigger": "smuggled", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1751, "end": 1752, "mention": "it", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1926, "end": 1934, "trigger": "announced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2021, "trigger": "increases", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2110, "trigger": "announced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2116, "end": 2125, "trigger": "assistance", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2246, "end": 2252, "trigger": "protest", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2214, "end": 2226, "mention": "Demonstrators", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2313, "end": 2316, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2357, "trigger": "message", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2454, "end": 2461, "trigger": "protests", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2473, "end": 2485, "trigger": "demonstrators", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2473, "end": 2485, "mention": "demonstrators", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2572, "end": 2579, "trigger": "protests", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2825, "end": 2834, "trigger": "subsidized", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2938, "end": 2942, "trigger": "lined", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2986, "end": 2993, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 3016, "end": 3019, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2996, "end": 3002, "mention": "Morales", "role": "entity"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130422.0048", "document": "EX-DEFENSE MINISTER ON TRIAL IN GREEK CORRUPTION CASE ATHENS, Greece – In the most high-profile criminal trial of a politician in Greece for more than two decades, a former defense minister, Akis Tsochatzopoulos, appeared in a court here Monday charged with setting up a complex money laundering network to cover the trail of millions of euros in bribes. Tsochatzopoulos, 73, a onetime socialist heavyweight, is on trial with his wife, daughter and 16 former aides and associates alleged to have participated in the scheme. He, his relatives and another five suspects have been in custody at Athens’ high-security Korydallos Prison for the past year. The charges are highly unusual in a country where top-ranking state officials are rarely prosecuted. Tsochatzopoulos is accused of using a network of offshore companies during his stint as defense minister between 1996 and 2001, and for several years after that, to siphon off millions of euros in bribes he is said to have taken in exchange for procurement contracts, including the purchase of a Russian missile defense system and German submarines. According to prosecutors, Tsochatzopoulos received around 160 million euros, or about $210 million, in bribes for those two deals which were worth an estimated 3 billion euros. Authorities have traced 57 million euros. The former minister, a founding member of the country’s once dominant socialist party, Pasok, which is now part of a conservative-led coalition, has denied the charges. He is claiming his prosecution is politically motivated. With public anger growing after the years of economic crisis, the government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has vowed to crack down on corruption among the political elite whom most Greeks blame for the dysfunctional state system that created the country’s huge debt problem and led it to dependence on foreign rescue loans. In an unusually severe sentence in February, a court in Salonika, Greece’s second-largest city, convicted the former mayor, Vassilis Papageorgopoulos, to life in prison for embezzling at least 18 million euros from city coffers. In September, the Greek authorities began examining the bank accounts of more than 30 politicians to determine whether they should be charged with tax evasion and other crimes. Last month, three former ministers were charged with submitting false income declarations. Tsochatzopoulos is the most senior government official to stand trial since the former prime minister and Pasok founder, Andreas Papandreou, was acquitted in 1991 on charges of accepting bribes.", "event_args": [{"start": 0, "end": 9, "trigger": "EX-DEFENSE", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 32, "end": 36, "mention": "GREEK", "role": "place"}, {"start": 38, "end": 47, "mention": "CORRUPTION", "role": "crime"}]}, {"start": 23, "end": 27, "trigger": "TRIAL", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 32, "end": 36, "mention": "GREEK", "role": "place"}, {"start": 38, "end": 47, "mention": "CORRUPTION", "role": "crime"}]}, {"start": 105, "end": 109, "trigger": "trial", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 62, "end": 67, "mention": "Greece", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 166, "end": 171, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 62, "end": 67, "mention": "Greece", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 245, "end": 251, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 238, "end": 243, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 233, "end": 236, "mention": "here", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 347, "end": 352, "trigger": "bribes", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 233, "end": 236, "mention": "here", "role": "place"}, {"start": 238, "end": 243, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 771, "end": 777, "trigger": "accused", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 752, "end": 766, "mention": "Tsochatzopoulos", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 857, "end": 863, "trigger": "between", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 848, "end": 855, "mention": "minister", "role": "position"}, {"start": 840, "end": 846, "mention": "defense", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 827, "end": 829, "mention": "his", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 949, "end": 954, "trigger": "bribes", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 956, "end": 957, "mention": "he", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1041, "trigger": "purchase", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1151, "trigger": "received", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1115, "end": 1125, "mention": "prosecutors", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1247, "trigger": "worth", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1128, "end": 1142, "mention": "Tsochatzopoulos", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1325, "end": 1330, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1332, "end": 1339, "mention": "minister", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1351, "trigger": "founding", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1332, "end": 1339, "mention": "minister", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 1481, "end": 1487, "trigger": "charges", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1519, "trigger": "prosecution", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1505, "end": 1507, "mention": "his", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1905, "trigger": "sentence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1910, "end": 1917, "mention": "February", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1938, "mention": "Salonika", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1979, "trigger": "convicted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1931, "end": 1938, "mention": "Salonika", "role": "place"}, {"start": 1910, "end": 1917, "mention": "February", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1985, "end": 1990, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1910, "end": 1917, "mention": "February", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1938, "mention": "Salonika", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2057, "trigger": "embezzling", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1931, "end": 1938, "mention": "Salonika", "role": "place"}, {"start": 1910, "end": 1917, "mention": "February", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2244, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2223, "end": 2226, "mention": "they", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 2299, "end": 2304, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2306, "end": 2314, "mention": "ministers", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 2321, "end": 2327, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2436, "end": 2440, "trigger": "trial", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2452, "end": 2457, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2484, "end": 2490, "trigger": "founder", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2517, "end": 2525, "trigger": "acquitted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2530, "end": 2533, "mention": "1991", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2538, "end": 2544, "trigger": "charges", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2530, "end": 2533, "mention": "1991", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2559, "end": 2564, "trigger": "bribes", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2530, "end": 2533, "mention": "1991", "role": "time"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130501.0255", "document": "COURT PAPERS OFFER DETAILS IN TERROR CASE The terrorism case landed on the public docket in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn last year like a riddle. Prosecutors charged three foreign men arrested overseas with supporting a Somali terrorist group. They did not reveal details of the allegations against the men, their nationalities or even their connections to the United States. Then on Wednesday, some details finally emerged in government documents, though much about the case remains to be seen. The court documents offer a glimpse of the government’s rationale for bringing suspects accused of being foreign terrorists into the federal court system – something that has happened with greater frequency in the past few months, even as the approach has been criticized for not having clearly defined limits. The men, prosecutors said, participated in attacks against Americans by consorting with others whom the U.S. government believes to be terrorists. These kinds of charges, called material support of terrorism charges, are allowed under the United States’ broad terrorism laws, which allow prosecution of those suspects believed to have associated with accused terrorists. Some personal information also emerged about them: Madhi Hashi is a British citizen, and Mohamed Yusuf is a Swedish citizen. The nationality of the third man, Ali Yasin Ahmed, was not revealed, but he was assisted by Swedish counsel at a previous hearing. A defense lawyer for Yusuf, Ephraim Savitt, said that the men were freedom fighters in a cause that had nothing to do with the United States and that the men would offer that defense at trial. All three, who were arrested in Africa while traveling to Yemen, have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say they traveled to Somalia to join to al-Shabab, a U.S.-designated terrorist group linked to al-Qaida. In addition, the documents charge that the men were connected to two U.S. citizens from Minnesota’s Somali community, Shirwa Ahmed and Farah Mohamed Beledi, suicide bombers who died in recent years in Somalia. In October 2008, Swedish authorities intercepted phone calls between Ali Yasin Ahmed and Yusuf, in which the men discussed their plans to travel to Somalia to join al-Shabab and die as martyrs, according to the documents. The conversation came after suicide bombings in two Somali cities targeting the government there, and the two men discussed the attacks. After an attack in Mogadishu in 2009, Ali Yasin Ahmed said during an intercepted phone call that he was an associate of the suicide bomber responsible for that bombing. Prosecutors then also pointed to the men’s suicide bomber training in 2011 in Somalia and association with Beledi, who prosecutors said bombed a government checkpoint in Mogadishu that year.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130504.0098", "document": "'Hiccup girl' seeks deal in killing LARGO — ''Hiccup girl’' Jennifer Mee, who is charged with first-degree murder, has offered to plead guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for a 15-year prison sentence, her attorney John Trevena said in court Friday. Assistant State Attorney Christopher LaBruzzo said prosecutors would discuss the offer. Mee became known as the ''hiccup girl’' in 2007 because of a case of hiccups that lasted months. A video of her hiccuping became an Internet sensation. But in 2010, she was arrested along with two men and charged with murder. St. Petersburg police said the trio plotted to rob Shannon Griffin, 22, who was found shot to death at a vacant home just north of downtown. Mee and the others have each been charged with first-degree murder and face mandatory life sentences without parole. Prosecutors have indicated some willingness to agree to a plea bargain, but perhaps not on terms the defendants would accept. They previously agreed to let Mee’s co-defendant Laron Cordale Raiford plead guilty in exchange for a 40-year prison sentence, but he turned the offer down. He is 22. In Mee’s case, Trevena said he is eager to hear from prosecutors about the suggested 15-year prison sentence. He said he had made previous offers which prosecutors rejected. First, he sought to get Mee designated as a ''youthful offender’' with a six-year sentence. Prosecutors also turned down an offer for Mee to get a 10-year prison sentence. Also on Friday, attorneys discussed testimony from a witness who at one point said one of the defendants, Lamont Antonio Newton, 25, was the one who actually shot Griffin. But prosecutors don’t necessarily need to prove that. Under Florida law, someone can be convicted of murder if he or she committed a serious felony crime — such as robbery — and someone was killed as a result. That’s exactly what happened in this case, according to police. Attorneys also discussed possible June trial dates for Mee in case discussions over a plea agreement fall through. The trial originally was scheduled for this month, but will be delayed because of an illness in the family of one of the prosecutors. Mee’s trial will be conducted separately from her two co-defendants, Newton and Raiford.", "event_args": [{"start": 81, "end": 87, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 74, "end": 76, "mention": "who", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 196, "end": 203, "trigger": "sentence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 74, "end": 76, "mention": "who", "role": "defendant"}, {"start": 181, "end": 187, "mention": "15-year", "role": "sentence"}]}, {"start": 232, "end": 235, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 181, "end": 187, "mention": "15-year", "role": "sentence"}, {"start": 74, "end": 76, "mention": "who", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 515, "end": 522, "trigger": "arrested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 507, "end": 509, "mention": "she", "role": "person"}, {"start": 501, "end": 504, "mention": "2010", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 547, "end": 553, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 507, "end": 509, "mention": "she", "role": "defendant"}, {"start": 501, "end": 504, "mention": "2010", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 615, "end": 617, "trigger": "rob", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 654, "end": 657, "trigger": "shot", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 640, "end": 642, "mention": "who", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 662, "end": 666, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 640, "end": 642, "mention": "who", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 743, "end": 749, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 709, "end": 711, "mention": "Mee", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 800, "end": 808, "trigger": "sentences", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 709, "end": 711, "mention": "Mee", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 818, "end": 823, "trigger": "parole", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 709, "end": 711, "mention": "Mee", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1076, "trigger": "sentence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1054, "end": 1060, "mention": "40-year", "role": "sentence"}]}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1226, "trigger": "sentence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1122, "end": 1124, "mention": "Mee", "role": "defendant"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1210, "mention": "15-year", "role": "sentence"}]}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1382, "trigger": "sentence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1317, "end": 1319, "mention": "Mee", "role": "defendant"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1373, "mention": "six-year", "role": "sentence"}]}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1462, "trigger": "sentence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1427, "end": 1429, "mention": "Mee", "role": "person"}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1446, "mention": "10-year", "role": "sentence"}]}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1509, "trigger": "testimony", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1481, "end": 1489, "mention": "attorneys", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1478, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1626, "trigger": "shot", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1628, "end": 1634, "mention": "Griffin", "role": "target"}]}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1733, "trigger": "convicted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1710, "end": 1716, "mention": "someone", "role": "defendant"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1703, "mention": "Florida", "role": "place"}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1743, "mention": "murder", "role": "crime"}]}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1832, "trigger": "killed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1748, "end": 1749, "mention": "he", "role": "attacker"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1716, "mention": "someone", "role": "target"}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1756, "mention": "she", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1954, "trigger": "trial", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1945, "end": 1948, "mention": "June", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1966, "end": 1968, "mention": "Mee", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 2030, "end": 2034, "trigger": "trial", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2166, "end": 2170, "trigger": "trial", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2160, "end": 2162, "mention": "Mee", "role": "defendant"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130506.0045", "document": "TAMERLAN TSARNAEV ’ S BODY READY FOR BURIAL. BUT WHERE? BOSTON – As the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings, lay in a Worcester, Mass., funeral home for a fourth day, Gov. Deval Patrick said Monday that it was up to the family, not the state, to resolve where the burial would take place. “First of all, this isn’t a state or a federal issue – it’s the family’s issue,” he told reporters in New Bedford, Mass. “And the family has some options. I assume they will make a decision soon. I hope they do.” Patrick declined to answer when asked if he would oppose Tsarnaev’s burial in Massachusetts. But Rep. Edward J. Markey, the Democratic candidate for the Senate seat that John Kerry vacated when he became secretary of state, said he would oppose such a burial. “I think that the body should be controlled by the federal government,” Markey said. “But if the people of Massachusetts do not want that terrorist to be buried on our soil, then it should not be.” No cemetery has offered space for Tsarnaev, who with his younger brother has been accused of planning and carrying out the bombings, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others on April 15. His brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, has been charged with the bombings and is being held in a federal medical detention facility outside Boston. Federal officials said they had no jurisdiction or interest in getting involved in the burial controversy. An FBI official said that the body was no longer needed in the investigation and that the burial was up to the family and the local authorities. As the stalemate continued, one of three men facing charges related to the bombings was released from federal custody. At a detention hearing Monday afternoon, Robel K. Phillipos, a former college student who is accused of lying to investigators, was released to his mother’s custody while he awaits trial. In a joint motion, lawyers for the defense and prosecution asked Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler of U.S. District Court in Massachusetts to release Phillipos, 19, on $100,000 bail on the condition that he stay under house arrest and wear an electronic tracking bracelet. Bail was to be secured with real estate put up by a third party; the address where he is to be held under house arrest will not be made public.", "event_args": [{"start": 146, "end": 153, "trigger": "bombings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 420, "end": 423, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 397, "end": 398, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 425, "end": 433, "mention": "reporters", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 730, "end": 736, "trigger": "vacated", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 746, "end": 751, "trigger": "became", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1130, "end": 1137, "trigger": "bombings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1060, "end": 1062, "mention": "his", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1151, "trigger": "killed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1060, "end": 1062, "mention": "his", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1176, "trigger": "injured", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1060, "end": 1062, "mention": "his", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1263, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1281, "trigger": "bombings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1299, "trigger": "held", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1349, "end": 1354, "mention": "Boston", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1667, "trigger": "charges", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1704, "trigger": "released", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1743, "end": 1749, "trigger": "hearing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1751, "end": 1756, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1860, "end": 1867, "trigger": "released", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1913, "trigger": "trial", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1751, "end": 1756, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1975, "end": 1979, "trigger": "asked", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2043, "end": 2055, "mention": "Massachusetts", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2060, "end": 2066, "trigger": "release", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2043, "end": 2055, "mention": "Massachusetts", "role": "place"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2076, "mention": "Phillipos", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 2095, "end": 2098, "trigger": "bail", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2086, "end": 2093, "mention": "$100,000", "role": "money"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2076, "mention": "Phillipos", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 2142, "end": 2147, "trigger": "arrest", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1948, "end": 1949, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2140, "mention": "house", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2191, "end": 2194, "trigger": "Bail", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2308, "trigger": "arrest", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2257, "end": 2258, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2297, "end": 2301, "mention": "house", "role": "place"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130506.0130", "document": "DEATH ROW INMATE ’ S REQUEST FOR DNA TESTING IS REJECTED The state of Mississippi rejected on Monday a request to submit physical evidence for DNA testing made by a prisoner scheduled to be put to death Tuesday evening. Willie J. Manning, convicted in 1994 of murdering two college students, had been repeatedly rebuffed in the courts as he sought to have DNA tests performed on certain crime scene evidence. But the most recent requests came about because of two letters sent by the Justice Department in recent days to the prosecutor who handled Manning’s trial. The letters concerned the trial testimony of an FBI expert asked to examine “hair fragments” found at the scene of the murders. The expert testified that in this case he could determine only that the hairs came from an African-American but that hair comparison analysis was capable, given better samples, of matching a hair to a particular individual. Manning is black; the murder victims were white. The prosecutor cited this testimony several times in his closing arguments. In a letter dated May 2, the Justice Department said the expert’s testimony about the general capability of hair analysis – that it could match a hair to a specific individual – was erroneous and “exceeded the limits of the science.” Then, in a letter dated May 4, the department further said that such analysis could not “determine” that a hair came from a person of a certain race, as the expert testified at one point, only that the hair “possesses certain traits that are associated with a particular racial group.” The FBI offered in both letters to perform DNA testing on the hair fragments. Manning’s lawyers argued that these letters constituted new evidence and thus that the hairs, as well as other evidence collected at the scene including a rape kit and fingernail scrapings, should be submitted for DNA testing before Manning is put to death.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130508.0098", "document": "ENRON ’ S SKILLING STRIKES DEAL FOR SHORTER SENTENCE Jeffrey K. Skilling, imprisoned for the last six years because of his role in the fraud that caused the collapse of Enron, has reached a deal that could reduce his sentence by more than a decade. As part of the agreement with the Justice Department, the former chief executive of the energy giant will waive his rights to any further appeals. In addition, he has agreed to allow more than $40 million of assets that were seized from him to be distributed to victims of Enron’s failure. Employees lost their retirement savings and shareholders lost billions of dollars after the once highflying company slid into bankruptcy in 2001. Under federal prison rules, Skilling – who had been sentenced to 24 years and 4 months – could leave prison as soon as 2017. The agreement is still subject to approval by Judge Simeon T. Lake III of U.S. District Court in Houston, who oversaw Skilling’s trial in 2006. Though the judge has some discretion over the ultimate length of the sentence, either side can appeal if he goes outside the guidelines. A resentencing hearing has been scheduled for June 21. If approved, the pact would conclude Skilling’s long legal battle with the government over his role in Enron’s implosion. Convicted of fraud and conspiracy, the onetime Enron leader, who is now 59, was the highest-ranking executive of the Houston-based company to serve a prison sentence. Kenneth L. Lay, Enron’s chairman, was also found guilty, but he died just over a month after the trial. Andrew S. Fastow, the company’s former chief financial officer, was released from prison in 2011, having served about five years under the terms of a plea agreement. “The proposed agreement brings certainty and finality to a long painful process,” Daniel M. Petrocelli, a lawyer for Skilling, said in a statement. “Although the recommended sentence for Jeff would still be more than double any other Enron defendant, all of whom have long been out of prison, Jeff will at least have the chance to get back a meaningful part of his life.” Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said in a statement that “this agreement ensures that Skilling will be appropriately punished for his crimes and that victims will finally receive the restitution they deserve.” The negotiations on the prison sentence followed a Supreme Court ruling in 2010 that questioned the use of the “honest services” law that helped convict Skilling, finding it unconstitutionally vague. A federal appeals court subsequently ruled that Skilling’s conviction was not tainted by the use of the legal theory, concluding that there was “overwhelming evidence” that the executive had conspired to commit fraud. But the appeals court also ruled that Skilling needed to have his sentence recalculated. The resentencing had been postponed while his appeal worked its way through the courts. Skilling – a onetime McKinsey consultant who joined Enron in 1990 and then quickly climbed the ranks – transformed the company from a pipeline operator into a global energy-trading giant. But after accounting schemes that hid the company’s debts and cash-flow problems came to light, he became a symbol of corporate wrongdoing. Several Enron subordinates testified at Skilling’s trial that their former boss helped foster an environment that allowed fraud to bloom. Enron led a wave of accounting scandals that emerged after the great Internet and telecommunications boom of the late 1990s fizzled. The crumbling of onetime titans led to thousands of lost jobs and a plunge in the stock market. In 2005, Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, was sentenced to 25 years for an accounting fraud at his telecommunications company, while John J. Rigas of the cable company Adelphia Communications received a 15-year sentence. The collapses of Enron and WorldCom helped change the way government approached white-collar crime and prompted Congress to pass the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on corporate accountability. Skilling, now also known as prisoner 29296-179, first began serving his sentence at a prison in Waseca, Minn. He was subsequently moved to an institution in Littleton, Colo., after the Minnesota facility was converted into a women’s penitentiary. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Bureau of Prisons website projected his release on Feb. 21, 2028.", "event_args": [{"start": 44, "end": 51, "trigger": "SENTENCE", "subtype": "NA", "arguments":

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130509.0160", "document": "FOCUS TURNS TO THREE SUSPECTS IN BELGIAN DIAMOND ROBBERY PARIS – Investigators in three countries continued unraveling the plot behind a brazen $50 million diamond robbery in Belgium, focusing Thursday on a Swiss lawyer, a real estate businessman and a French luxury car exporter with a prison record for fraud. After a series of raids Tuesday and Wednesday in Switzerland, Belgium and France, the authorities started releasing some of the more than 30 men who were arrested and questioned in connection with the Feb. 18 robbery, in which armed men in police suits attacked a Zurich-bound plane minutes before takeoff from the Brussels airport. Investigators in Belgium and Switzerland suspect that a critical organizer in the plot was Marc Bertoldi, 43, a French car exporter whose listed address was in a wealthy seaside neighborhood of Antibes on the Cote d’Azur and who owns a restaurant in Casablanca, Morocco. He was arrested Tuesday in France and remains in prison, awaiting a hearing May 16 in Metz for extradition to Belgium. Investigators said Bertoldi’s arrival in Geneva after the theft had provided a critical breakthrough in the inquiry. After Bertoldi’s arrest, the police trailed an unidentified Swiss lawyer and a real estate owner Wednesday as they made an exchange of a key to a cellar where some of the stolen diamonds were discovered. Bertoldi’s lawyer, Olivier Rondu, said Thursday that his client denied the accusations against him and was willing to be extradited to Belgium to confront the charges. “He has a surprising position that he wants to go to Belgium as quickly as possible to explain himself, because he says he has done nothing,” Rondu said. “He denies participating in the robbery at Brussels airport.” Rondu also confirmed that his client had been convicted in the past for fraud and robbery and had served a prison term. In Switzerland, where eight people were arrested Wednesday, the real estate owner and the Swiss lawyer remained in detention. Francois Canonica, a lawyer for the Swiss lawyer, also denied any wrongdoing on his client’s part, telling a Swiss newspaper, Tribune de Geneve, “My client has faith that ultimately he will be acquitted.”", "event_args": [{"start": 49, "end": 55, "trigger": "ROBBERY", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 33, "end": 39, "mention": "BELGIAN", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 164, "end": 170, "trigger": "robbery", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 175, "end": 181, "mention": "Belgium", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 287, "end": 292, "trigger": "prison", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 305, "end": 309, "mention": "fraud", "role": "crime"}]}, {"start": 418, "end": 426, "trigger": "releasing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 466, "end": 473, "trigger": "arrested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 336, "end": 342, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 521, "end": 527, "trigger": "robbery", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 565, "end": 572, "trigger": "attacked", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 610, "end": 616, "trigger": "takeoff", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 768, "end": 775, "trigger": "exporter", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 764, "end": 766, "mention": "car", "role": "artifact"}]}, {"start": 923, "end": 930, "trigger": "arrested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 916, "end": 917, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}, {"start": 932, "end": 938, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 943, "end": 948, "mention": "France", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 965, "end": 970, "trigger": "prison", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 943, "end": 948, "mention": "France", "role": "place"}, {"start": 916, "end": 917, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 984, "end": 990, "trigger": "hearing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1002, "end": 1005, "mention": "Metz", "role": "place"}, {"start": 916, "end": 917, "mention": "He", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1021, "trigger": "extradition", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1002, "end": 1005, "mention": "Metz", "role": "place"}, {"start": 916, "end": 917, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1065, "end": 1071, "trigger": "arrival", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1054, "end": 1061, "mention": "Bertoldi", "role": "person"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1081, "mention": "Geneva", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1174, "trigger": "arrest", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1158, "end": 1165, "mention": "Bertoldi", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1194, "trigger": "trailed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1158, "end": 1165, "mention": "Bertoldi", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1282, "trigger": "exchange", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1249, "end": 1257, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1265, "mention": "they", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1486, "trigger": "extradited", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1451, "end": 1453, "mention": "him", "role": "person"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1497, "mention": "Belgium", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1572, "trigger": "go", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1577, "end": 1583, "mention": "Belgium", "role": "destination"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1560, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1675, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1666, "end": 1670, "mention": "Rondu", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1716, "trigger": "robbery", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1786, "end": 1794, "trigger": "convicted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1828, "trigger": "robbery", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1843, "trigger": "served", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1907, "trigger": "arrested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1909, "end": 1917, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1975, "end": 1983, "trigger": "detention", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1909, "end": 1917, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1880, "mention": "where", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2085, "end": 2091, "trigger": "telling", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2066, "end": 2068, "mention": "his", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2187, "trigger": "acquitted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2019, "end": 2020, "mention": "he", "role": "defendant"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130525.0040", "document": "MILITANT SAYS HE IS BEHIND FATAL NIGER ATTACK DAKAR, Senegal - Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the mastermind of the January seizure of an Algerian gas plant that left dozens of foreign hostages dead, has claimed responsibility for another terrorist attack - the suicide bombings on Thursday in Niger that killed about 30 people, including 24 soldiers and at least six jihadists. If true, Belmokhtar’s claim would put one of the Sahel’s most hardened militants, whom Chad’s military said in March it had killed in battle, back at the center of the region’s fight against Islamist jihad. Experts saw no reason to doubt Belmokhtar’s claim, despite the unconfirmed claim by the Chadian military, which said that Belmokhtar had died in the Ifoghas mountain range during the joint French-Chadian campaign against Islamist militants in northern Mali. Neither France nor Algeria, where Belmokhtar has been a wanted man for years for his role in the 1990s civil war there, ever confirmed Chad’s assertion. No proof was presented of his death, and a fellow militant later denied it in an Internet posting. The latest claim by Belmokhtar - a veteran of training by al-Qaida in Afghanistan, years of terrorist acts against the Algerians and multiple kidnappings of Westerners in the Sahara - came hours after bomb-laden vehicles ripped through a military installation and a French-owned uranium mine in Niger. Belmokhtar, who is considered perhaps the most redoubtable of the region’s surviving militants, also played a leading role in the Islamist takeover of northern Mali last year. The new claim was made on a number of different websites. In one, Belmokhtar himself, using his nom de guerre Khalid Abu al-Abbas, signed a claim on jihadist forums that fighters from his “Those Who Sign with Blood” brigade - the same group that carried out the Algeria attack - blew up the French mine and the Niger base, according to the SITE Monitoring Service, which tracks extremists. The claim was posted by the same user who put out a video of Belmokhtar in December, SITE said, and it asserted that the attacks were in retaliation for purported assertions by Niger to have defeated the jihadists. “We warn all the countries that are intending to participate in the Crusader campaign on our land, even if in the name of peacekeeping, that we will make you taste the heat of death and wounds in your homelands and among your soldiers,” SITE quoted Belmokhtar as saying.", "event_args": [{"start": 27, "end": 31, "trigger": "FATAL", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "mention": "MILITANT", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 39, "end": 44, "trigger": "ATTACK", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 33, "end": 37, "mention": "NIGER", "role": "Target"}]}, {"start": 113, "end": 119, "trigger": "seizure", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 105, "end": 111, "mention": "January", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 183, "end": 186, "trigger": "dead", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 105, "end": 111, "mention": "January", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 238, "end": 243, "trigger": "attack", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 251, "end": 257, "trigger": "suicide", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 105, "end": 111, "mention": "January", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 259, "end": 266, "trigger": "bombings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 294, "end": 299, "trigger": "killed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 271, "end": 278, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 283, "end": 287, "mention": "Niger", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 492, "end": 497, "trigger": "killed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 479, "end": 483, "mention": "March", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 502, "end": 507, "trigger": "battle", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 450, "end": 453, "mention": "whom", "role": "target"}, {"start": 479, "end": 483, "mention": "March", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 712, "end": 715, "trigger": "died", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 942, "end": 944, "trigger": "war", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 930, "end": 934, "mention": "1990s", "role": "time"}, {"start": 852, "end": 858, "mention": "Algeria", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1020, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1012, "end": 1014, "mention": "his", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1082, "trigger": "posting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1138, "trigger": "training", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1155, "end": 1165, "mention": "Afghanistan", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1190, "trigger": "acts", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1237, "trigger": "kidnappings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1319, "trigger": "ripped through", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1533, "trigger": "takeover", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1517, "end": 1524, "mention": "Islamist", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1699, "trigger": "signed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1838, "trigger": "attack", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1825, "end": 1831, "mention": "Algeria", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1848, "trigger": "blew up", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1825, "end": 1831, "mention": "Algeria", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1967, "end": 1972, "trigger": "posted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2028, "end": 2035, "mention": "December", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1995, "end": 2001, "trigger": "put out", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2028, "end": 2035, "mention": "December", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2144, "end": 2151, "trigger": "defeated", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2130, "end": 2134, "mention": "Niger", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 2172, "end": 2175, "trigger": "warn", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2169, "end": 2170, "mention": "We", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2344, "end": 2348, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2309, "end": 2310, "mention": "we", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 2354, "end": 2359, "trigger": "wounds", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2309, "end": 2310, "mention": "we", "role": "agent"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130603.0111", "document": "BRITAIN AND ECUADOR MAY DISCUSS ASSANGE CASE LONDON - The Ecuadorean foreign minister is due to travel to London this month and has offered to meet his British counterpart to discuss the impasse over the Julian Assange case, officials from both countries said on Monday. Assange, the founder of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, has been holed up for nearly a year in the tiny Ecuadorean Embassy here, stymying British attempts to extradite him to Sweden. The Swedish authorities want to question Assange in connection with accusations that he sexually assaulted two women, but he has said he fears that the Swedes will in turn send him to the United States to answer questions about his role in helping disseminate classified government information via WikiLeaks. The development concerning Assange came on the same day as the court-martial of Pfc. Bradley Manning, the Army private accused of passing on sensitive diplomatic and military information, was scheduled to begin in Maryland. Manning has pleaded guilty to 20 of the 22 charges against him, but he has not admitted to the most serious charge, aiding the enemy. Manning has said he gave the material to WikiLeaks, which then helped disseminate it. Assange has never acknowledged that Manning was his source. A spokesman for the Ecuadorean government said last week that the foreign minister, Ricardo Patino, planned to travel to London on June 16, three days before Assange’s first anniversary in the embassy, and to meet with Assange. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador has informed U.K. authorities that Mr. Patino will be in London and has offered to meet with Foreign Secretary William Hague to discuss the case of Julian Assange,” the spokesman said. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said it was informed of Patino’s trip on Friday and was “considering” his request for a meeting with Hague. “U.K. government officials have been in regular contact with representatives of the Ecuadorean government, both in London and Quito, about Mr. Assange,” the Foreign Office said in a statement. “We hope the visit will contribute to our joint commitment to finding a diplomatic solution to this issue.” Last week, Reuters quoted Patino as saying his government was preparing a document in which it would argue that Britain is legally obliged to give Assange permission to travel to South America.", "event_args": [{"start": 24, "end": 30, "trigger": "DISCUSS", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 12, "end": 18, "mention": "ECUADOR",

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130613.0153", "document": "SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER CITES 'PROGRESS' IN MANDELA'S CONDITION EDS: TWEAKS lede; CORRECTS time element in 3rd graf; SUBS 2 grafs starting “Government officials” and ADDS 4 grafs to end with quote from grandson and Mandela background.) JOHANNESBURG - After four days in the hospital battling a lung infection, former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa “is responding better to treatment,” President Jacob Zuma told Parliament in Cape Town on Wednesday. “We are very happy with the progress that he’s now making, following a difficult few days,” Zuma said. It was the first report of an improvement in Mandela’s condition since he was admitted to a hospital in Pretoria early Saturday after suffering a recurrence of a persistent lung ailment, a legacy of the tuberculosis he contracted during the 27 years he was imprisoned for opposing apartheid. His health has been frail lately, and this hospitalization was his fourth in the last seven months. Government officials in the last few days had been more downbeat, describing Mandela’s condition as “serious but stable” with no improvement. Mandela, 94, is being treated in an intensive care unit, where close family members have been visiting him regularly. Among them are his daughters, his former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and his grandson Mandla Mandela. His current wife, Graça Machel, canceled a speech in London to be by his side. Mandla Mandela, who is a traditional leader in the Eastern Cape village where his grandfather was born, spoke to reporters outside Mandela’s home. “My grandfather is the father of the nation,” he said. “He’s embraced by the global community, and we appreciate the support that we’ve received.” As an underground leader of the banned African National Congress, Mandela was convicted of treason 49 years ago Wednesday.

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) MOGADISHU, Somalia - Militants staged a deadly assault on a U.N. compound here Wednesday, the latest in a series of attacks that have chipped away at the security gains the Somali capital has experienced in recent years. The Shabab, the fearsome Islamist militant group that once controlled much of the capital, claimed responsibility for the attack, which government officials said left at least 15 people dead, including seven attackers. The assault began when Shabab militants blew up a pickup truck rigged with explosives outside the compound, witnesses said. Militants armed with rifles and wearing explosive vests then stormed the facility on foot. Somali and African Union troops responded to the scene. The ensuing firefight lasted more than an hour, punctuated by a series of blasts. Somalia’s minister of interior and national security, Abdikarim Hussein Guled, told reporters that the dead included four foreigners, four Somalis working for the United Nations as security personnel, as well as the attackers. In a statement, Somalia’s prime minister, Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid, condemned “the senseless and despicable attack on innocent U.N. civilians.” Mogadishu has experienced a period of relative calm since African Union forces and the Somali army pushed back the Shabab, leading it to announce a hasty retreat from the city in 2011. The militant group vowed to shift tactics more toward guerrilla assaults, assassinations and suicide bombings. Militants “are now in complete control of the entire compound and the battle is still ongoing,” the Shabab said on its Twitter feed during the attack. “Inside the compound are several clueless foreigners who were lulled into a false sense of security by a strong disinformation campaign!” The Shabab, who have sworn allegiance to al-Qaida, said that the group’s Martyrdom Brigade had carried out the attack. The U.N. compound sits on a busy stretch of road near the airport. An ambulance worker, Abdirisak Moumin, said that he had collected 13 wounded civilians, six of whom died from their injuries. Nicholas Kay, the U.N. special representative for Somalia, was outside the compound at a meeting nearby when the attack occurred. He called the attack an act of terrorism intended to derail Somalia’s drive toward recovery after decades of war and instability. While the United Nations would review its security procedures, “the U.N. is committed to its mission,” Kay said in a telephone interview. “We’re here to help and we’re here to stay.”", "event_args": [{"start": 10, "end": 15, "trigger": "ATTACK", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 0, "end": 8, "mention": "MILITANTS", "role": "Attacker"}, {"start": 34, "end": 40, "mention": "SOMALIA", "role": "Place"}]}, {"start": 206, "end": 211, "trigger": "deadly", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 245, "end": 253, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 187, "end": 195, "mention": "Militants", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 213, "end": 219, "trigger": "assault", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 245, "end": 253, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 187, "end": 195, "mention": "Militants", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 282, "end": 288, "trigger": "attacks", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 245, "end": 253, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 187, "end": 195, "mention": "Militants", "role": "attacker"}, {"start": 240, "end": 243, "mention": "here", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 509, "end": 514, "trigger": "attack", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 544, "end": 547, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 573, "end": 576, "trigger": "dead", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 595, "end": 603, "trigger": "attackers", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 610, "end": 616, "trigger": "assault", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 646, "end": 652, "trigger": "blew up", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 791, "end": 797, "trigger": "stormed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 853, "end": 861, "trigger": "responded", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 889, "end": 897, "trigger": "firefight", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1041, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1043, "end": 1051, "mention": "reporters", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1065, "trigger": "dead", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1043, "end": 1051, "mention": "reporters", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1199, "trigger": "statement", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1299, "trigger": "attack", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1434, "trigger": "pushed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1490, "trigger": "retreat", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1461, "end": 1462, "mention": "it", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1512, "mention": "2011", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1586, "trigger": "assaults", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1602, "trigger": "assassinations", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1623, "trigger": "bombings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1701, "trigger": "battle", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1626, "end": 1634, "mention": "Militants", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1736, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1774, "trigger": "attack", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1726, "end": 1731, "mention": "Shabab", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2026, "end": 2031, "trigger": "attack", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2140, "end": 2143, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2165, "trigger": "collected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2170, "end": 2176, "trigger": "wounded", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2204, "trigger": "died", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2217, "end": 2224, "trigger": "injuries", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2316, "end": 2322, "trigger": "meeting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2340, "end": 2345, "trigger": "attack", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2466, "end": 2468, "trigger": "war", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2417, "end": 2423, "mention": "Somalia", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2614, "end": 2622, "trigger": "interview", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2590, "end": 2592, "mention": "Kay", "role": "entity"}]}]}

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) JOHANNESBURG - Singing crowds gathered outside the hospital where Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s former president, lay in a critical state for a third consecutive day Tuesday, as family members held an emergency meeting at his ancestral village. Mandela’s eldest daughter, Makaziwe, at least two grandchildren and clan elders gathered at Mandela’s retirement house in Qunu, the remote southern village where he grew up, according to news media reports. The subject of the meeting was not publicly disclosed, but Naplisi Mandela, an elder of the Mandela family, told the South African Press Association that they had gathered to discuss “delicate matters” - a euphemism widely interpreted to mean preparations for Mandela’s death. Meanwhile, in Pretoria, doctors continued to treat Mandela for a lung ailment that he contracted on Robben Island, the notorious apartheid-era prison where he spent much of his 27 years behind bars until his release in 1990. He was hospitalized June 8, his fourth hospitalization since late last year. In a statement, President Jacob Zuma said Mandela’s condition was unchanged. On Sunday, he visited Mandela and pronounced that his state had deteriorated from stable to critical. Noting that Mandela’s 95th birthday is on July 18, Zuma urged South Africans to celebrate his achievements. Still, after 18 days of anxious vigil, many appeared to be steeling themselves for the worst. Larger-than-usual crowds gathered at the gates of the Mediclinic Heart Hospital to pay tribute to Mandela, as people dropped off cards at a growing shrine and sang songs. “There is no one like you, Nelson Mandela,” one group sang in the Sotho language. The emotional scenes were part of a perceptible shift in the national mood. Until recently, many South Africans had avoided talking about Mandela’s fate, calling it culturally inappropriate to speculate about any ailing figure, much less one as revered as Mandela, who played a central role in South Africa’s transition from white-led minority rule to historic multirace elections in 1994. But now many are openly talking about the prospect of bidding him farewell. Mandela’s declining condition came as President Barack Obama prepared to arrive in South Africa on Friday on the second leg of an African tour that will also take him to Tanzania and Senegal. But the South African government said a planned meeting between Obama and Mandela - both the first black leaders of their countries - now looked unlikely.", "event_args": [{"start": 61, "end": 67, "trigger": "MEETING", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 139, "end": 143, "trigger": "story", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 223, "end": 230, "trigger": "gathered", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 405, "end": 411, "trigger": "meeting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 360, "end": 366, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 519, "end": 526, "trigger": "gathered", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 466, "end": 473, "mention": "Makaziwe", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 754, "end": 757, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 809, "end": 816, "trigger": "gathered", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 916, "end": 920, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 713, "end": 719, "mention": "Mandela", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1119, "trigger": "behind bars", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1006, "end": 1007, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1137, "trigger": "release", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1142, "end": 1145, "mention": "1990", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1007, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1166, "trigger": "hospitalized", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1148, "end": 1149, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1201, "trigger": "hospitalization", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1176, "end": 1178, "mention": "his", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1238, "trigger": "statement", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1322, "trigger": "visited", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1313, "end": 1314, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1310, "mention": "Sunday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1330, "mention": "Mandela", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1345, "trigger": "pronounced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1313, "end": 1314, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1310, "mention": "Sunday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1330, "mention": "Mandela", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1438, "trigger": "birthday", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1416, "end": 1422, "mention": "Mandela", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1631, "end": 1638, "trigger": "gathered", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2230, "end": 2238, "trigger": "elections", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2243, "end": 2246, "mention": "1994", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2322, "trigger": "farewell", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2257, "end": 2260, "mention": "many", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2398, "end": 2403, "trigger": "arrive", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2424, "end": 2429, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2463, "end": 2466, "trigger": "tour", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2455, "end": 2461, "mention": "African", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2553, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2571, "trigger": "meeting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2591, "end": 2597, "mention": "Mandela", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 2581, "end": 2585, "mention": "Obama", "role": "entity"}]}]}

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) KABUL, Afghanistan - A court has reversed the convictions of three Afghans jailed for torturing a young relative who had refused to become a prostitute, alarming activists who had celebrated the guilty verdicts as a warning to all those who would seek to reverse the strides made by women here in the past 12 years. A family had bought the young woman, Sahar Gul, from her stepbrother for $5,000 and had forced her to marry in 2011, when she was just 13 or 14. When she refused to consummate the marriage, her in-laws locked her in a basement, where they burned her with hot wires, pulled out her fingernails and twisted her skin with pliers for months. She was discovered in December 2011 curled up in a dank and dark corner of the cellar and badly malnourished. Gul now lives in a shelter in Kabul. Her case attracted widespread attention in Afghanistan and abroad. Three of her in-laws were convicted last year of attempted murder, and each was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The convictions were upheld on appeal, although her husband, who is in his 30s, remains at large. Last month, however, in a decision that received little publicity, the Supreme Court sent the case back to the appeals court, saying that the violence appeared to warrant convictions for assault, not attempted murder, according to lawyers for the defendants. The appeals court agreed, voiding the convictions and ordering that the defendants - Gul’s mother-in-law, sister-in-law and father-in-law - be set free. The two women were released this week after about a year in prison, the lawyers said. They were not sure whether the father-in-law was yet out of prison. As word spread in Kabul on Wednesday, Western officials said they were still gathering details but would probably have a response in the coming days. Afghan women’s rights activists reacted with alarm and said they would press to have the three defendants retried. “There’s smoke coming out of my hair. I am so angry,” said Manizha Naderi, the executive director of Women for Afghan Women. “This poor girl was in the basement for months. If she wasn’t rescued, she would be dead. She was starved and burned and had her fingernails pulled out. How is this not attempted murder?” The courts’ decisions make “a statement that violence against women is not that important, that Afghanistan is becoming more conservative,” Naderi added.", "event_args": [{"start": 22, "end": 31, "trigger": "CONVICTION", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 36, "end": 42, "trigger": "TORTURE", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "mention": "AFGHAN", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 229, "end": 239, "trigger": "convictions", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 258, "end": 263, "trigger": "jailed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 269, "end": 277, "trigger": "torturing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 512, "end": 517, "trigger": "bought", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 572, "end": 577, "mention": "$5,000", "role": "money"}]}, {"start": 601, "end": 605, "trigger": "marry", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 552, "end": 554, "mention": "her", "role": "person"}, {"start": 610, "end": 613, "mention": "2011", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 679, "end": 686, "trigger": "marriage", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 649, "end": 651, "mention": "she", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 738, "end": 743, "trigger": "burned", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 733, "end": 736, "mention": "they", "role": "attacker"}, {"start": 689, "end": 691, "mention": "her", "role": "target"}]}, {"start": 765, "end": 770, "trigger": "pulled", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 689, "end": 691, "mention": "her", "role": "target"}, {"start": 727, "end": 731, "mention": "where", "role": "place"}, {"start": 733, "end": 736, "mention": "they", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 796, "end": 802, "trigger": "twisted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 733, "end": 736, "mention": "they", "role": "attacker"}, {"start": 689, "end": 691, "mention": "her", "role": "target"}]}, {"start": 1077, "end": 1085, "trigger": "convicted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1139, "trigger": "sentenced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1122, "end": 1125, "mention": "each", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1443, "trigger": "convictions", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1449, "end": 1455, "mention": "assault", "role": "crime"}]}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1569, "trigger": "convictions", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1671, "trigger": "set free", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1645, "end": 1657, "mention": "father-in-law", "role": "defendant"}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1639, "mention": "sister-in-law", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1700, "trigger": "released", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1739, "trigger": "prison", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1815, "trigger": "out", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1825, "trigger": "prison", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1820, "end": 1825, "mention": "prison", "role": "origin"}]}, {"start": 2084, "end": 2090, "trigger": "retried", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2147, "end": 2150, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2302, "end": 2305, "trigger": "dead", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2269, "end": 2271, "mention": "she", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 2328, "end": 2333, "trigger": "burned", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2308, "end": 2310, "mention": "She", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2364, "trigger": "pulled", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2343, "end": 2345, "mention": "her", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 2451, "end": 2458, "trigger": "violence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2468, "end": 2472, "mention": "women", "role": "target"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130709.0087", "document": "MICHAEL MASTROMARINO, DENTIST GUILTY IN ORGAN SCHEME, DIES AT 49 Michael Mastromarino, a former dental surgeon who became a tabloid sensation when he was charged with running a $4.6 million enterprise that plundered tissue and bone from corpses at funeral homes and sold them for transplants and research, died on Sunday at St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital in Newburgh, N.Y. He was 49 and still serving a prison term. The cause was complications of metastatic liver cancer, Mario Gallucci, Mastromarino’s lawyer, said. The technology that allows the transplantation of critical organs also enables the far more common transplantation of tissue: bone can be used to repair fractures, veins for heart bypass surgery, and tendons and ligaments can restore mobility. Harvesting organs is allowed in New York state, provided the donor does not carry a potentially communicable disease, the survivors approve and the person is not too old. But there are nowhere near enough willing donors to meet the demand for tissue, so the profit from one body can reach six figures. Mastromarino became licensed by New York state to supply tissue banks and manufacturers of biological surgical instruments after his dental license was suspended in 2002 because of a drug addiction. He established a network of undertakers, whom he paid up to $1,000 per corpse, and soon took on assistants and formed a business based in New Jersey, Biomedical Tissue Services. He reportedly made $10,000 to $15,000 per body. But Mastromarino harvested organs and tissue from bodies without consent from the survivors, the authorities said, and removed material from people with cancer, HIV and other diseases. He then forged paperwork, including consent forms and death certificates, to make the cause of death and age acceptable. The police began investigating irregularities at the Daniel George &amp; Son Funeral Home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, in 2005. News reports included lurid details, like what the police called a secret room in the funeral home equipped with specialized surgical equipment; leg bones replaced by PVC pipe so bodies would appear intact at viewings (this procedure is common in lawful bone removal); and the fact that one of the victims was Alistair Cooke, the British journalist and former host of “Masterpiece Theater,” whose arm and leg bones were taken even though he had had cancer. Mastromarino was charged in 2006, along with two of his workers and an embalmer. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to numerous charges of enterprise corruption, reckless endangerment and body stealing and was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison. He and his wife, Barbara, agreed to pay $4.6 million to the district attorney’s office, to be distributed among the victims’ relatives. Michael Mastromarino was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 16, 1963. He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh and the New York University College of Dentistry. Mastromarino had surgical offices in New Jersey and Manhattan. He was a co-author, with Michael R. Wiland, of the book “Smile: How Dental Implants Can Transform Your Life.” Mastromarino, who was divorced, is survived by two sons, Michael and Jerry. As for Cooke, his daughter, Susan Cooke Kittredge, said in an article in New York magazine that “he would have been just horrified” by the illegal harvesting. But, she said, “at the same time, he would have appreciated the Dickensian nature of it.”", "event_args": [{"start": 54, "end": 57, "trigger": "DIES", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 89, "end": 94, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 154, "end": 160, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 143, "end": 144, "mention": "he", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 266, "end": 269, "trigger": "sold", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 306, "end": 309, "trigger": "died", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 271, "end": 274, "mention": "them", "role": "thing"}]}, {"start": 391, "end": 397, "trigger": "serving", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 371, "end": 372, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1022, "trigger": "profit", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1116, "trigger": "supply", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1061, "end": 1072, "mention": "Mastromarino", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1312, "trigger": "paid", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1271, "end": 1272, "mention": "he", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1376, "trigger": "formed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1271, "end": 1272, "mention": "he", "role": "giver"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1336, "mention": "corpse", "role": "thing"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1365, "mention": "assistants", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1455, "trigger": "made", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1438, "end": 1439, "mention": "He", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 2270, "end": 2275, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2391, "end": 2397, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2402, "end": 2405, "mention": "2006", "role": "time"}, {"start": 2374, "end": 2385, "mention": "Mastromarino", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 2493, "end": 2499, "trigger": "charges", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2455, "end": 2456, "mention": "He", "role": "defendant"}, {"start": 2476, "end": 2479, "mention": "2008", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2575, "end": 2583, "trigger": "sentenced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2455, "end": 2456, "mention": "He", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 2650, "end": 2652, "trigger": "pay", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2614, "end": 2615, "mention": "He", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 2775, "end": 2778, "trigger": "born", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2783, "end": 2790, "mention": "Brooklyn", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 3103, "end": 3110, "trigger": "divorced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3095, "end": 3097, "mention": "who", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3208, "end": 3211, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130710.0155", "document": "EXTRADITED COLOMBIAN TO FACE CHARGES OF DRUG TRAFFICKING A Colombian who has been described by his country’s president as “the last of the great kingpins” was extradited to the United States from Colombia on Tuesday to face charges that he manufactured large quantities of cocaine that he then trafficked to the U.S. and elsewhere. Daniel Barrera is to be arraigned Wednesday and Thursday in U.S. district courts in Manhattan and Brooklyn, where he faces separate indictments. After those prosecutions, he will be arraigned in Miami on additional charges, the authorities said. Barrera, also known as El Loco, was arrested in September in Venezuela as a result of a complex operation that included Colombian and Venezuelan authorities, the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the British intelligence. He was later sent to Colombia, and his extradition was announced by the U.S. attorneys in the three jurisdictions and other officials, including Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner of New York; and Michele M. Leonhart, the head of the DEA. An indictment in Manhattan says that Barrera relied on two Colombian terrorist organizations to carry out his operations, buying raw cocaine paste from members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and processing it in laboratories in areas controlled by another group, to which he paid fees. Barrera’s organization produced upward of 400 tons of cocaine a year, “enriching itself and the two terrorist organizations it paid off,” said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. Loretta E. Lynch, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said Barrera’s organization was “marked by its worldwide reach, ruthless criminality and staggering profits.” Barrera is charged in Manhattan with one count of narcotics importation conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. He faces a money laundering conspiracy charge in Brooklyn. His lawyer declined to comment. Officials have said that Barrera, while residing in Venezuela, changed his appearance through plastic surgery, slept in different places and burned his fingertips to try to make it impossible to identify him.", "event_args": [{"start": 0, "end": 9, "trigger": "EXTRADITED", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 29, "end": 35, "trigger": "CHARGES", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []},

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130712.0047", "document": "EGYPT CALLS FOR NEW LOOK AT MORSI PRISON ESCAPE EDS: SUBS throughout to refocus on court case against Morsi; NEW headline.) ; (This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) CAIRO - Egypt’s new rulers gave new credence to a court case against the ousted president, Mohammed Morsi, and members of the Muslim Brotherhood on Thursday over their escape from prison during the uprising that toppled his predecessor, Hosni Mubarak. The case was transferred from an appeals court to the State Security prosecutor for further investigation. No charges have been filed as yet. Its acceptance by powerful prosecutors follows the arrest of many Muslim Brotherhood members and is a new blow to the group by the military-backed government. The detentions have been criticized by rights groups and the Obama administration, which spent Thursday walking back remarks made early in the day by a State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, seeming to criticize Morsi as undemocratic and in so doing seeming to validate the military’s move to oust him. At her regular State Department briefing Thursday, asked about the reactions, Psaki said she had been “referring to all of the voices that have been - we have heard coming - the millions, I should say, coming from Egypt, and how strongly they have voiced their views about his rule. But beyond that is up for the Egyptian people to determine.” The renewed investigation of Morsi and members of the Muslim Brotherhood dates to the uprising that led to the ouster of Mubarak in 2011. Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders were arrested Jan. 28 and held in the Wadi Natroun prison north of Cairo, until they escaped two days later. The case languished after Morsi was elected last year in the country’s first free presidential race, although local news outlets and Morsi’s opponents accused militants from Hamas, the Brotherhood’s Palestinian offshoot, of freeing their colleagues. Morsi has not been seen publicly since his ouster July 3. It is unclear where he is being held, or whether he and the others will face the charges in court. The ouster of Morsi and the subsequent suppression of the Brotherhood has enraged the group’s members and led to a spate of scapegoating attacks by Muslim extremists against Christians they accuse of supporting his fall, rights activists said. While tensions between the Christian minority and extremist elements in the Muslim majority are not new, attacks have been reported across the country - in the northern Sinai Peninsula, in a resort town on the Mediterranean Coast, in Port Said along the Suez Canal and in isolated villages in upper Egypt.", "event_args": [{"start": 41, "end": 46, "trigger": "ESCAPE", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 89, "end": 92, "trigger": "case", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 102, "end": 106, "mention": "Morsi", "role": "defendant"}, {"start": 83, "end": 87, "mention": "court", "role": "adjudicator"}]}, {"start": 307, "end": 310, "trigger": "case", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 399, "end": 406, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 301, "end": 305, "mention": "court", "role": "adjudicator"}]}, {"start": 324, "end": 329, "trigger": "ousted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 259, "end": 263, "mention": "Egypt", "role": "place"}, {"start": 399, "end": 406, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 419, "end": 424, "trigger": "escape", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 399, "end": 406, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 413, "end": 417, "mention": "their", "role": "person"}, {"start": 431, "end": 436, "mention": "prison", "role": "origin"}]}, {"start": 507, "end": 510, "trigger": "case", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 696, "end": 701, "trigger": "arrest", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 829, "end": 838, "trigger": "criticized", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1018, "end": 1022, "mention": "Morsi", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 921, "end": 927, "trigger": "remarks", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 887, "end": 891, "mention": "which", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 899, "end": 906, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1102, "trigger": "oust", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1104, "end": 1106, "mention": "him", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1141, "end": 1148, "trigger": "briefing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1150, "end": 1157, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1114, "mention": "her", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1569, "trigger": "ouster", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1574, "end": 1580, "mention": "Mubarak", "role": "person"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1588, "mention": "2011", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1639, "trigger": "arrested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1591, "end": 1595, "mention": "Morsi", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1718, "trigger": "escaped", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1707, "end": 1710, "mention": "they", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1772, "end": 1778, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1762, "end": 1766, "mention": "Morsi", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1887, "end": 1893, "trigger": "accused", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2029, "end": 2034, "trigger": "ouster", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2025, "end": 2027, "mention": "his", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2131, "trigger": "charges", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2059, "end": 2060, "mention": "he", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 2147, "end": 2152, "trigger": "ouster", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2157, "end": 2161, "mention": "Morsi", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2280, "end": 2286, "trigger": "attacks", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2492, "end": 2498, "trigger": "attacks", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130716.0036", "document": "SNOWDEN SUBMITS APPLICATION FOR ASYLUM IN RUSSIA MOSCOW - Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor on the run from U.S. authorities, formally applied Tuesday for temporary asylum in Russia, citing fears that he could face torture or the death penalty if extradited to the United States, according to a Russian official who assisted in preparing the documents. Snowden, whose leak of National Security Agency information has set off a worldwide debate over the U.S. government’s surveillance programs, has not been accused of a capital crime and does not face the death penalty. His stated fears, whatever their merit, will help him to meet requirements for asylum in Russia. President Vladimir Putin of Russia has said that he would consider allowing Snowden to stay in Russia, provided that he “cease his work aimed at inflicting damage on our American partners.” Putin reiterated that offer Monday while meeting with science students, but he said that Snowden had initially refused and that the situation remained uncertain. Snowden has said he does not believe his leaks have harmed U.S. interests. The formal submission of the asylum application Tuesday seemed to clear things up - at least for the moment - and suggested that the end of Snowden’s sojourn at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, where he arrived from Hong Kong on June 23, might finally be in sight. WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization, which has been assisting Snowden, posted a message on Twitter confirming the submission of his asylum application. During a meeting Friday with human rights advocates and lawyers, Snowden said he would request temporary shelter in Russia but ultimately planned to travel to Latin America, where three countries have expressed a willingness to take him. He accused the United States of violating international law by blocking him from traveling there straight away. Anatoly Kucherena, a rights advocate who has worked closely with the Kremlin, who was one of the officials to meet with Snowden on Friday, confirmed the submission of the asylum application. In an interview on the Rossiya 24 television station, Kucherena said he had helped Snowden prepare the documents at the airport and had delivered them to the Federal Migration Service, which handles such requests. The Kremlin did not offer any immediate assessment of Snowden’s chances. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told Russian news agencies that the Migration Service was handling the application. He said Putin, who was traveling in the Far East and Siberia on Tuesday, was focused on domestic issues. In the past week a number of prominent Russians, many of them conservative-leaning Kremlin loyalists, have spoken in Snowden’s favor, characterizing him as a whistle-blower and a defender of human rights who was deserving of protection. Federal prosecutors in Virginia have charged Snowden with two counts of violating the Espionage Act and also with stealing government property - each charge punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for a total of 30 years. But Snowden and his supporters in and outside of Russia have cited the existence of the death penalty in the United States as a reason he should not be extradited, noting that U.S. officials have said he could face additional charges.", "event_args": [{"start": 81, "end": 86, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 235, "end": 241, "trigger": "torture", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 78, "end": 79, "mention": "he", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 250, "end": 254, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 78, "end": 79, "mention": "he", "role": "target"}, {"start": 78, "end": 79, "mention": "he", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 256, "end": 262, "trigger": "penalty", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 78, "end": 79, "mention": "he", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 267, "end": 276, "trigger": "extradited", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 78, "end": 79, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 388, "end": 391, "trigger": "leak", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 382, "end": 386, "mention": "whose", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 527, "end": 533, "trigger": "accused", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 382, "end": 386, "mention": "whose", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 576, "end": 580, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 382, "end": 386, "mention": "whose", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 582, "end": 588, "trigger": "penalty", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 382, "end": 386, "mention": "whose", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 919, "end": 925, "trigger": "meeting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 906, "end": 911, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 878, "end": 882, "mention": "Putin", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1085, "trigger": "leaks", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1077, "end": 1079, "mention": "his", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1317, "end": 1323, "trigger": "arrived", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1116, "end": 1117, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1460, "trigger": "posted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1551, "trigger": "meeting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1601, "end": 1607, "mention": "Snowden", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1558, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1690, "trigger": "travel", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1614, "end": 1615, "mention": "he", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1855, "end": 1863, "trigger": "traveling", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1865, "end": 1869, "mention": "there", "role": "destination"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1848, "mention": "him", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1996, "end": 1999, "trigger": "meet", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2006, "end": 2012, "mention": "Snowden", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2022, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2083, "end": 2091, "trigger": "interview", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2131, "end": 2139, "mention": "Kucherena", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2221, "trigger": "delivered", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2097, "end": 2098, "mention": "he", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 2401, "end": 2404, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2508, "end": 2516, "trigger": "traveling", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2538, "end": 2544, "mention": "Siberia", "role": "destination"}, {"start": 2549, "end": 2555, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 2500, "end": 2502, "mention": "who", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 2697, "end": 2702, "trigger": "spoken", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2864, "end": 2870, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2872, "end": 2878, "mention": "Snowden", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 2984, "end": 2993, "trigger": "punishable", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2872, "end": 2878, "mention": "Snowden", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 3016, "end": 3021, "trigger": "prison", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2872, "end": 2878, "mention": "Snowden", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 3137, "end": 3141, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3143, "end": 3149, "trigger": "penalty", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3201, "end": 3210, "trigger": "extradited", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3117, "end": 3118, "mention": "he", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 3275, "end": 3281, "trigger": "charges", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}]}

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) SEOUL, South Korea - State prosecutors armed with metal detectors raided the Seoul residence of former President Chun Doo-hwan on Tuesday to look for assets of the ex-military dictator who owes South Korea 167.5 billion won ($150 million) in fines but claims to be broke. In a Supreme Court ruling in 1997, Chun, now 82, was ordered to return to the state 220 billion won he illegally accumulated through bribery from big businesses during his eight and a half years in power in the 1980s. He has so far paid only a quarter of the amount. In his last payment, he handed in 3 million won he said he collected as a lecture fee. Chun has rarely appeared in public since he stepped down in 1988 and entered a Buddhist monastery. In the 1997 verdict, he was also convicted of sedition for his role in the 1979 military coup that brought him to power and a 1980 military crackdown that left hundreds of people dead in the southwestern city of Kwangju. He initially was sentenced to death, a penalty that was reduced to a life imprisonment. He was later pardoned and freed. On Tuesday, a team of 90 prosecutors, tax collectors and other investigators ransacked Chun’s home in eastern Seoul. Television footage showed them hauling away paintings, porcelain and expensive artifacts. The investigators also searched the properties owned by his eldest son, Chun Jae-kook. The son’s publishing company, Sigongsa Inc., is one of the country’s largest and has published the Korean translations of books by John Grisham, C.? S. Lewis and Roald Dahl. There was no immediate comment from Chun Doo-hwan’s family about the raids Tuesday. Chun has been dogged by prosecutors for years. In 2000, they seized a Mercedes-Benz sedan from him. In 2003, they confiscated a refrigerator, television set and golf clubs and auctioned them off. At the time, Chun claimed to have less than $260 in his bank accounts, although opposition lawmakers alleged that he may have had huge assets stashed away. Last month, the National Assembly passed a bill extending the statute of limitations on confiscating assets from public officials who have failed to pay fines. Under the old law, prosecutors had only until October. The new law extended the statute of limitations on Chun’s case until 2020 and allowed prosecutors to collect from his family members as well if they could prove that any of their properties originated from Chun’s illegal funds.", "event_args": [{"start": 25, "end": 30, "trigger": "FORMER", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3, "end": 10, "mention": "SECUTORS", "role": "Attacker"}, {"start":

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130731.0133", "document": "JUAN DAVID OCHOA V Á SQUEZ, MEDELL Í N CARTEL CO-FOUNDER, DIES AT 65 Juan David Ochoa Vásquez, a founder of the violent and powerful Medellín cartel in Colombia, which ruled the international cocaine trade in the 1980s, died on Thursday in a medical clinic in Medellín. He was 65. The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press in Bogotá reported. Ochoa was one of three brothers who raised horses and ran restaurants before their family built a brutal, billion-dollar business smuggling drugs to the United States and other countries. The Ochoas - Juan David was the oldest, followed by Jorge Luis and Fabio - were perhaps less infamous than some of their partners. Another co-founder of the cartel, Pablo Escobar, was linked to hundreds of murders before he was killed by the police in 1993. Another partner, Carlos Lehder Rivas, who smuggled drugs from a private island in the Bahamas before joining the Medellín, was convicted of drug trafficking and is serving a life sentence in federal prison in the United States. In the early 1990s, all three Ochoa brothers surrendered and pleaded guilty to certain crimes under an agreement with the Colombian government that included limited sentences to be served in Colombia. The brothers served about five years in prison, where they lived together, sewed saddles and ate their mother’s cooking - in part because she was worried that another cook might try to poison them. Juan David was the last of his brothers to agree to the plea deal, which was offered at a time when the Colombian government was increasing pressure on drug lords, including Escobar. “My mother, my sisters kept saying, 'Get out of this - save yourself,'” he told The New York Times in an interview from prison in 1995. The Ochoas had all been released by 1996, but Fabio later returned to prison after being charged with new crimes in the late 1990s. He was eventually extradited to the United States, and in 2003 was convicted of two counts of drug conspiracy. He is serving a 30-year sentence. The family fought Fabio’s extradition with an aggressive but unsuccessful legal and public relations campaign. Juan David and Jorge Luis avoided extradition, but other governments found at least some ways to punish them. In 1987, federal authorities in the United States seized a ranch and 39 Paso Fino walking horses that Juan David owned in Central Florida. Later, after his release from prison, he returned to raising horses and, he said, respectability. “Everyone loves us; the doors open for us all over,” Juan David Ochoa said in an interview with The Times on the day his brother was extradited. “Unfortunately, in a bad time and bad hour, when we were younger, we got into that business.”", "event_args": [{"start": 58, "end": 61, "trigger": "DIES",

After approving a series of mergers between the nation’s airlines in recent years, the Justice Department’s decision came as a surprise to both carriers, who had expressed confidence the deal would go through with only a few changes. Antitrust regulators had not challenged an airline merger since the planned tie-up between United Airlines and US Airways in 2001. Since then, Delta Air Lines merged with Northwest Airlines, United merged with Continental, and Southwest merged with AirTran. In recent years, however, consumer groups and some economists have warned that the wave of consolidation in the airline sector had contributed to higher airfares and less choice for consumers. “Today’s action proves our determination to fight for the best interests of consumers by ensuring robust competition in the marketplace,” said Eric H. Holder Jr., the U.S. attorney general. The civil antitrust lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to challenge the planned deal. The Justice Department said the vast majority of domestic airline routes were already highly concentrated. A merger of American and US Airways, it said, would result in four airlines controlling more than 80 percent of the U.S. market for commercial air travel. It also found that the planned merger would have created a dominant carrier at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, where it would control 69 percent of the takeoff and landing slots and have a monopoly on 63 percent of the nonstop routes served from there. The two airlines said they would defend their merger plan. “We believe that the DOJ is wrong in its assessment of our merger. Integrating the complementary networks of American and US Airways to benefit passengers is the motivation for bringing these airlines together,” they said in a statement. “Blocking this pro-competitive merger will deny customers access to a broader airline network that gives them more choices.” The participating attorneys general are from Texas and Arizona, where American and US Airways are based, as well as Florida, the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia.", "event_args": [{"start": 363, "end": 369, "trigger": "lawsuit", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 371, "end": 377, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 409, "end": 414, "trigger": "merger", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 572, "end": 577, "trigger": "merger", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 707, "end": 713, "trigger": "mergers", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1077, "trigger": "merged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1116, "trigger": "merged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1123, "end": 1133, "mention": "Continental", "role": "org"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1109, "mention": "United", "role": "org"}]}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1155, "trigger": "merged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1140, "end": 1148, "mention": "Southwest", "role": "org"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1168, "mention": "AirTran", "role": "org"}]}, {"start": 1788, "end": 1793, "trigger": "merger", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1798, "end": 1805, "mention": "American", "role": "org"}]}, {"start": 2256, "end": 2261, "trigger": "merger", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2250, "end": 2254, "mention": "their", "role": "org"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130816.0151", "document": "No special session, but protesters leave Capitol Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau TALLAHASSEE — They weren’t able to persuade Gov. Rick Scott to call a special session on the controversial ''stand your ground’' law. But the student activists known as the Dream Defenders drew national attention to their cause by holding the longest sit-in demonstration at the Florida Capitol in recent memory. On Thursday, the Miami-based group announced that their record-setting protest is over — for now, at least. ''After 31 days and 30 nights, we are leaving the Capitol for our next phase,'' Dream Defenders executive director Phillip Agnew said. Agnew said the group would register thousands of new voters in the coming months and return to the Capitol for legislative committee hearings in the fall. The Dream Defenders’ occupation of the Capitol began July 16, three days after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager from Miami-Dade. They promised to stay until Scott convened a special session on ''stand your ground’' and several other criminal justice issues. ''We said if (Scott) would not give us a seat at the table, we would sleep on the floor until (he) gave us what we deserved,'' Agnew said. Scott met with the protesters July 18 but refused their demands. The Dream Defenders tried to persuade state lawmakers to call the session themselves, but they couldn’t muster the 96 votes needed. As of Thursday, 42 lawmakers had voted in favor of holding the session, 90 voted against, and 28 had yet to vote. This week, House Speaker Will Weatherford called for the group’s departure. The Dream Defenders claimed several victories, including a promise from Weatherford to hold a hearing on the ''stand your ground’' law this fall. The group also secured meetings with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to discuss racial profiling, Agnew said, and began a dialogue with the state Department of Juvenile Justice on the disproportionate number of young African-American men in prison. Agnew said the Dream Defenders had not been pressured to wrap up their protest by the governor’s office or state law enforcement officials. The Capitol Police who had watched over the group, Agnew added, ''deserved a raise.'' The state spent a total of $153,630 on police overtime throughout the protest, according to FDLE. The Dream Defenders didn’t anticipate their stay would last a month or that singer Harry Belafonte, rapper Talib Kweli or civil rights leaders Jesse Jackson and Julian Bond would join them in the Capitol. ''Gov. Scott, through his inaction, created a new group of leaders who will have a lasting effect on Florida,'' said state Rep. Alan Williams, a Tallahassee Democrat who mentored the group. When they packed up their belongings and left the Capitol Thursday evening, the young activists wondered aloud if there had been some level of divine intervention along the way. On Wednesday, the state Department of Management Services announced plans to test the fire alarm system in the Capitol. The testing would last from 8 p.m. until midnight, and involve an ''incredibly loud, high-pitch noise,'' according to a press release. But before the testing began, the building adjacent to the Capitol was struck by lightning. The Department of Management Services decided to perform maintenance on that building’s fire alarm system instead. ''I don’t know how to explain it,'' Dream Defender Steven Pargett said. '' Some things are just meant to happen.''

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130822.0136", "document": "A PINK-SLIP THANKS FOR A MAJOR DECISION On Baseball); When John Gaherin, the chief labor negotiator for Major League Baseball, arrived for a meeting with the chief of the players union and baseball’s arbitrator, he carried an envelope in the pocket of his suit jacket. It was two days before Christmas 1975, not a time to be conducting serious business, but Gaherin and Marvin Miller, the executive director of the union, knew why Peter Seitz, the arbitrator, had summoned them. They knew that the subject of the meeting would be as serious a bit of business as baseball had ever experienced, and Gaherin went to the meeting prepared. Seitz had informally telegraphed his decision in a grievance case, and now he would formally hand his written opinion to the two men. As soon as he did, Gaherin handed Seitz the envelope. “You’re fired,” it said in effect. Such is the perilous life of impartial arbitrators in baseball and other professional sports. Either side - the league or the union - has the right to fire them. Like managers, they are hired to be fired. “He told me he had expected as much,” Michael Seitz, Peter’s son, said in a recent telephone interview. “His feeling was there was no other way to decide the case, because the baseball owners had been stupid in assuming that when they didn’t have a player under contract, they still had a contractual hold on him.” Fredric R. Horowitz, a 64-year-old lawyer from Santa Monica, Calif., is the latest to take a turn. He will arbitrate Alex Rodriguez’s appeal of his 211-game suspension. While arbitrators pay for their decisions, which anger either the owners or the players, they don’t always receive credit for the significance of their decisions. Seitz, for example, was responsible for creating free agency in baseball with his decision in the 1975 Andy Messersmith-Dave McNally grievance, but I believe, as Marvin Miller used to complain, that some reports in the news media, including in The New York Times, mistakenly credited other cases: Curt Flood’s 1970 lawsuit against baseball and Catfish Hunter’s 1974 grievance against Charlie Finley. Flood’s suit challenged the game’s reserve clause, the rule that bound a player to his team until he was traded, sold or released. Hunter’s grievance contended that Finley, the Oakland Athletics’ owner, had breached his contract. The Hunter case was exactly what the union argued, a breach-of-contract case. Finley had not paid the premium on Hunter’s annuity, as stipulated in his contract, Richard Moss, the union lawyer, said, and the pitcher should be a free agent as a result. Seitz, in his first year as baseball’s arbitrator, agreed with Moss’ argument and declared Hunter a free agent. A year later, when Seitz ruled in the Messersmith-McNally grievance, he did not cite the Hunter decision as a basis for this decision. As a breach-of-contract case, it affected no player but Hunter. No other player could gain free agency based on Seitz’s decision on Hunter. “It didn’t change the mind of a single owner,” Miller said of the Hunter decision in one of the many conversations we had on the subject. \"The owners’ position on free agency was the same after the Hunter case as it was before.'' Nor, Miller added, did the Flood case affect the owners’ thinking on the reserve clause and free agency. The reserve clause had forever been the tie that bound players to their teams, whether they liked it or not. Flood did not like it, and when the St. Louis Cardinals traded him to Philadelphia, he opted to sue the commissioner rather than go to the Phillies, contending that he should have the right to play where he wanted. The suit went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where Flood lost. The owners always argued that elimination of the reserve clause would ruin baseball, Miller said, and Flood’s loss in the lawsuit emboldened them to maintain their position. As heroic as Flood was in pursuing his lawsuit, it fell well short of having an effect. Its failure was one of the reasons the owners were so confident of winning the Messersmith-McNally grievance in court when they appealed Seitz’s decision, which said players could be free agents if they played the renewal year in their contract without signing a new contract. What the owners failed to understand, in their inexperience in labor matters, was that judges rarely overruled an arbitrator’s decision, doing so only if an arbitrator’s authority had been exceeded. The clubs and the commissioner have not done particularly well before arbitrators in instances where players have been suspended for conduct off the field. That history continued last year when Shyam Das overturned Ryan Braun’s 50-game suspension. Das was fired after his Braun ruling. Baseball would have preferred settling all of the doping cases stemming from the investigation into Biogenesis, an anti-aging clinic that is believed to have distributed banned substances to baseball players. The union also seemed eager to settle. But Rodriguez has appealed his 211-game suspension. Given the volatility of the Rodriguez case, it would not be surprising if Horowitz’s first major case were his last.", "event_args": [{"start": 127, "end": 133, "trigger": "arrived", "subtype": "NA",

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130910.0002", "document": "FAMILY OF EX-SOUTH KOREAN DICTATOR TO PAY HIS FINES SEOUL, South Korea - The children of a former military dictator of South Korea, Chun Doo-hwan, said Tuesday that they will pay 167 billion won ($154 million) that their father owed the government in fines. Their decision closes a chapter on South Korea’s prolonged struggle with the legacy of one of its most brutal former leaders. Chun, then an army major general, came to power in a coup in 1979 following the assassination of another military-backed strongman, President Park Chung-hee, who was the father of the current South Korean leader, President Park Geun-hye. Chun ruled until 1988, when he was succeeded by Roh Tae-woo, his partner in the 1979 coup. After South Korea’s transition to democracy, both Chun and Roh were convicted on charges of treason for their roles in the coup and a 1980 military crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in the southern city of Kwangju that left hundreds dead. They were also convicted of collecting huge bribes from big business while in office. In 1997, Chun was sentenced to life in prison and Roh to 17 years. Although they were later pardoned and freed, Chun and Roh had failed to pay the 220.5 billion won ($203 million) and 268.8 billion won ($248 million) that they were fined, respectively. Chun has so far paid only a quarter of his fine, claiming to have only 290,000 won ($267), in his bank accounts. But opposition lawmakers have said he might have huge assets stashed away. Chun’s case had appeared to close as the statute of limitations on confiscating assets from him was to expire this year. But in June, the National Assembly passed a bill that extended the statute of limitations on his case to 2020 and allowed prosecutors to collect from his family members as well if they can prove that any of their properties originated from Chun’s illegal funds. Prosecutors have since raided 90 facilities owned by the Chun family members, confiscating a total of 90 billion won ($83 million) worth of assets. Chun’s brother-in-law was arrested on tax evasion charges earlier this month. Chun Jae-yong, one of the former president’s three sons, was also under investigation on similar charges. “We bow deeply in apology,” Chun Jae-kook, the eldest son of Chun, said in a family statement that he read in front of the prosecutors’ office in Seoul on Tuesday. He said Chun’s three sons and daughter would give up buildings, land and paintings and other assets to help pay their father’s fine. He said the house where Chun and his wife live would also be sold to help pay the fine, though he asked government officials to let his parents live there until they die. Chun is 82. Lee Jin-han, a senior prosecutor, told reporters that the assets prosecutors have secured so far from Chun’s family members, including those they said they would give up on Tuesday, amounted to 170 billion won ($156 million) enough to cover Chun’s unpaid fine. Earlier this month, Roh paid off his fine. His brother and a businessman whose daughter divorced Roh’s son helped him pay the 23 billion won ($21 million) he still owed the government in fines.", "event_args": [{"start": 10, "end": 17,

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130910.0191", "document": "FAMILY OF EX-SOUTH KOREAN DICTATOR TO PAY HIS FINES EDS: MOVES UP apology reference; MINOR edits.) SEOUL, South Korea - The children of a former military dictator of South Korea, Chun Doo-hwan, said Tuesday that they would pay 167 billion won ($154 million) that their father owed the government in fines. “We bow deeply in apology,” Chun Jae-kook, Chun’s eldest son, said in a family statement that he read Tuesday in front of the prosecutors’ office in Seoul. Their decision closes a chapter on South Korea’s prolonged struggle with the legacy of one of its most brutal former leaders. Chun, then an army major general, came to power in a coup in 1979 after the assassination of another military-backed strongman, President Park Chung-hee, the father of the current South Korean leader, President Park Geun-hye. Chun ruled until 1988, when he was succeeded by Roh Tae-woo, his partner in the 1979 coup. After South Korea’s transition to democracy, both Chun and Roh were convicted of treason for their roles in the coup and a 1980 military crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in the southern city of Kwangju that left hundreds dead. They were also convicted of collecting huge bribes from big business while in office. In 1997, Chun was sentenced to life in prison and Roh to 17 years. Although they were later pardoned and freed, Chun and Roh had failed to pay the 220.5 billion won ($203 million) and 268.8 billion won ($248 million) that they were fined. Chun has so far paid only a quarter of his fine, claiming to have only 290,000 won ($267), in his bank accounts. But opposition lawmakers have said he might have huge assets stashed away. The statute of limitations on confiscating Chun’s assets was to expire this year. But in June, the National Assembly passed a bill that extended it to 2020 and allowed prosecutors to collect from his family members as well if they could prove that any of their properties originated from Chun’s illegal funds. Prosecutors have since raided 90 facilities owned by the Chun family members, confiscating a total of 90 billion won ($83 million) worth of assets. Chun’s brother-in-law was arrested on tax evasion charges earlier this month. Chun Jae-yong, one of the former leader’s three sons, is also under investigation on similar charges. Chun Jae-kook said he and his two brothers and sister would give up buildings, land, paintings and other assets to help pay their father’s fine. He said the house where Chun and his wife live would also be sold to help pay the fine, although he asked government officials to let his parents live there until they die. Chun is 82. Lee Jin-han, a senior prosecutor, told reporters that the assets prosecutors have secured so far from Chun’s family members, including those they said on Tuesday they would give up, amounted to 170 billion won ($156 million), enough to cover Chun’s unpaid fine. Roh paid off his fine this month. His brother and a businessman whose daughter divorced Roh’s son helped him pay the 23 billion won ($21 million) he still owed.", "event_args": [{"start": 38, "end": 40, "trigger": "PAY", "subtype":

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20130914.0094", "document": "Judge allows Mee to give interviews LARGO — A judge on Friday refused to stop ''Hiccup Girl’' Jennifer Mee from giving interviews to the media in the final days before her murder trial. Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Nancy Moate Ley also refused an unusual request to allow the Dr. Phil show to have a cellphone-sized video camera in the courtroom to interview Mee during breaks in her trial. Next week’s trial of Mee is expected to attract widespread media attention. Mee and her attorney, John Trevena, scheduled interviews in the Pinellas County jail with the Today show, Dr. Phil, Inside Edition, Bay News 9 and the Tampa Bay Times. But prosecutors objected in a motion filed Wednesday, saying the media blitz ''could make it difficult to select an impartial jury.'' It also said potential jurors could be exposed to ''irrelevant and inadmissible statements’' designed to ''elicit sympathy for the defendant.'' Ley said she believed impartial jurors can be found. After the hearing, the Sheriff’s Office and Trevena scheduled the media interviews for Monday morning, but that didn’t end the controversy. Prosecutors said they would send a homicide detective to sit in on the interviews, with a video camera, in case Mee says something incriminating. Trevena objects, saying ''that’s pure intimidation.'' Trevena has said Mee wants to do the interviews and has a First Amendment right to do so. Jurors typically are asked whether they have read news coverage of cases to ensure they haven’t decided someone’s guilt before a trial begins. Also Friday, Trevena said the Dr. Phil show was interested in providing a small video camera to interview Mee during breaks in the trial. He said the footage would be aired at some point after the trial. Trevena explained later that a member of the legal team could have interviewed Mee during courtroom breaks. This camera would have been in addition to the usual news cameras expected to be used by photographers throughout the trial. ''If your question to me is, 'Judge Ley, can we have Dr. Phil’s little camera or recorder in the courtroom for breaks in the trial …’ my answer is no thank you,'' Ley said. Diane Dimond, a reporter who specializes in covering criminal justice issues, said in an interview she had never heard of a lawyer carrying a camera for a TV show. Dimond said Joe Amendola, attorney for convicted child molester and retired Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky, arranged a pretrial interview with NBC sports anchor Bob Costas and facilitated an audio interview aired on Penn State radio platforms before his sentencing. Both interviews, intended to humanize Sandusky and present his perspective, were used as evidence against him, Dimond said. '' My warning to the lawyer is: The hand that feeds can also bite you,'' she said. One of the other people accused in the St. Petersburg murder was convicted last month in a trial that received scant publicity. Laron Cordale Raiford, 23, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The third defendant, Lamont Antonio Newton, 25, will go on trial after Mee. St. Petersburg police said the trio plotted to rob Shannon Griffin, 22. He was found shot to death at a vacant home just north of downtown. Under Florida law, someone can be convicted of murder if he or she commits a serious felony,  such as robbery, and someone is killed.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131003.0269", "document": "LEADER OF FAR-RIGHT PARTY IN GREECE IS JAILED This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) ATHENS, Greece - The leader of the extreme-right Golden Dawn party was returned to custody Thursday after appearing before a Greek magistrate on charges of setting up a criminal organization, part of the government’s crackdown on a party described by Greek and European authorities as neo-Nazi and violent. The magistrate’s order to remand Nikos Michaloliakos, the first political party leader to face jail since Greece’s seven-year military dictatorship ended in 1974, came a day after three of his fellow lawmakers facing similar charges were released from custody and told not to leave the country, and a fourth was ordered held pending trial. During more than six hours of testimony in an Athens courtroom, Michaloliakos condemned the murder last month of a 34-year-old hip-hop artist and anti-fascist, Pavlos Fyssas, by a self-professed supporter of Golden Dawn, and said he did not know whether members of the party were involved in violence, according to a court official. “I condemn the murder, like I condemn violence in general,” he was quoted as saying. “I am not a Nazi.” Leaving court early Thursday, Michaloliakos was defiant. “Long live Golden Dawn! Victory!” he declared as his wife, Eleni Zaroulia, another Golden Dawn member of Parliament, cried, “You’re a diamond!” and his daughter, Ourania Michaloliakou, urged him, “Don’t buckle, don’t give in!” Michaloliakos was transferred to the capital’s high-security Korydallos prison later in the day along with Yiannis Lagos, another Golden Dawn lawmaker. Giorgos Patelis, the head of the party’s chapter in Nikaia, near the spot where Fyssas was fatally stabbed, and an officer from the regional police precinct accused of supplying Golden Dawn with information were taken to two other jails in central Greece, state television reported. According to the police, Lagos telephoned Michaloliakos half an hour after the killing of Fyssas on Sept. 18. The lawmaker has been tied to protection and prostitution rackets as well as blackmail and money laundering, according to secret service documents leaked to the Greek media this week. Later Thursday, a sixth lawmaker, Christos Pappas, the party’s second in command, was also ordered returned to custody after testifying for at least six hours before a magistrate. He was to stay overnight at the Athens police headquarters before his transfer to prison. Arriving at the capital’s court complex, Pappas told reporters, “Golden Dawn will run in the next elections, whenever they may be.”", "event_args": [{"start": 39, "end": 44, "trigger": "JAILED",

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131022.0102", "document": "PROTESTS AS CITY COLLEGE CLOSES A STUDENT CENTER Julie Turkewitz contributed reporting. NEW YORK - It was just a small room, one of hundreds in City College’s North Academic Center, but over the years the Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur Student and Community Center had taken on a significance beyond its square footage. To student organizers who used it as their meeting space, it was a place for lesbian and gay activists, women’s rights groups, community organizations and others to make common cause. To outside critics it was a symbol of campus politics gone berserk, its unofficial name a glorification of City College alumni who had joined revolutionary organizations and gone on the lam. But officials at City College, part of the City University of New York, insisted that charged history was not a factor when they decided that the room would be better used as an annex for the school’s career services office, two floors below. Without notice, security officers entered the room this past weekend, boxed up and removed its contents - and just to be on the safe side, locked down the entire building, including the library. With just a day to go before midterm exams, the library was reopened after a few hours. But Room 3/201 was not, resulting at least for a brief while in the incongruous sight of closed doors emblazoned with a bold, black fist, below a crisp white sign that read Careers and Professional Development. (The door had been repainted, without the fist, as of Monday afternoon.) Given the center’s history, it could not have come entirely as a surprise when its former occupants let their dissatisfaction be known. They organized protest rallies, distributed fliers, posted videos and demanded that City College be shut down. A protester was arrested. And just in time for an outdoor demonstration on Monday, someone set off a fire alarm, sending hundreds of people out onto the plaza. “I think that the CUNY administration is really scared of a lot of the organizing and community-building coming out of the building,” said Alyssia Osorio, director of the Morales/Shakur Center. “We provide so many services for the community - know-your-rights training, a farm share that provides healthy food, we’ve run a soup kitchen, we have provided baby-sitting services for people in the community.” Deidra Hill, vice president of communications at City College, called the administration’s takeover of the room a matter of space. She said the career services office needed a quiet area where students can “meet with outside employers, with alumni, to seek advice on careers.” City College said the unusually swift action was necessary. “We were concerned that we might have to move people, and that would not have been safe,” Hill said. As for the protests, “Students were exercising their free speech rights, which the college supports,” she said. The City College students whom the center’s name honors have never visited. Guillermo Morales, a leader of the FALN, a Puerto Rican independence group that claimed responsibility for a deadly bombing in New York, fled to Cuba. So did Shakur, who as a member of the Black Liberation Army was convicted in the 1973 killing of a New Jersey State trooper. In 2006, a student objected to the name of the center. In the ensuing controversy, CUNY’s chancellor ordered that it be changed. But it stuck. Taf Sourov, 19, a member of the Revolutionary Student Coordinating Committee, a group that regularly met there, said he believed the closing was retaliation for student protests against David H. Petraeus, the former CIA director and military commander, who is teaching a course at the Macaulay Honors College. “I practically lived out of the room,” Sourov said. “I would do my homework in there. I did my political work in there. I would socialize in there. I feel like part of me is ripped out.”", "event_args": [{"start": 364, "end": 370, "trigger": "meeting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 679, "end": 682, "trigger": "gone", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 973, "end": 979, "trigger": "entered", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1028, "trigger": "removed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1663, "trigger": "protest", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1642, "end": 1645, "mention": "They", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1742, "end": 1750, "trigger": "shut down", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1642, "end": 1645, "mention": "They", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1763, "trigger": "protester", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1776, "trigger": "arrested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1823, "trigger": "demonstration", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1828, "end": 1833, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1866, "end": 1872, "trigger": "sending", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1836, "end": 1842, "mention": "someone", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1833, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2050, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2208, "trigger": "provides", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2108, "end": 2109, "mention": "We", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2754, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2702, "end": 2707, "mention": "people", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2660, "end": 2661, "mention": "we", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 2768, "end": 2775, "trigger": "protests", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2779, "end": 2786, "mention": "Students", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2936, "end": 2942, "trigger": "visited", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3054, "end": 3059, "trigger": "deadly", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3061, "end": 3067, "trigger": "bombing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3082, "end": 3085, "trigger": "fled", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3160, "end": 3168, "trigger": "convicted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3177, "end": 3180, "mention": "1973", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 3182, "end": 3188, "trigger": "killing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3177, "end": 3180, "mention": "1973", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 3533, "end": 3540, "trigger": "protests", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3525, "end": 3531, "mention": "student", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3573, "end": 3578, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3525, "end": 3531, "mention": "student", "role": "entity"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131025.0190", "document": "BLACK WIDOW'S 1985 WEB OF LIES UNRAVELS It was supposed to be the work of a barefoot man who snuck into a Houston couple’s home in 1985, raped a woman, killed a man and disappeared into the night. In reality, it was a wife who shot her seventh husband as he slept, then went on for 28 years living a lie. Carolyn Sue Krizan-Wilson, 71, admitted Wednesday in a Harris County courtroom that she shot Roy McCaleb, her husband of two years, almost three decades ago. In exchange for the plea, Krizan-Wilson was sentenced to six months in jail, to be followed by 10 years of deferred adjudication, a form of probation that means she will not have a conviction on her record if successfully completed. The victim’s family, who signed off on the deal, lost their composure after the plea. ''She said 'I did it,' and that’s what we really wanted to hear,'' said Linda Petty, McCaleb’s sister, with tears in her eyes. Krizan-Wilson will begin her six months in jail on Dec. 26, the day after Christmas. ''It is unfair that she gets to start serving her sentence after the holidays,'' McCaleb’s daughter, Pam Nalley, wrote in her statement to the court. '' How many holidays has she taken from us?'' McCaleb, a construction foreman, had just turned 51 when he was killed on Sept. 22, 1985. Krizan-Wilson was 43. In speaking to reporters after the killing, Krizan-Wilson told a fantastic story about being carjacked and raped 10 days before the shooting by a barefoot man with a knife. It was a crime that she did not report until after her husband’s death. She said the rapist returned and was able to walk into the couple’s North Shore home through an unlocked door on a Sunday night. She claimed the man again held a knife to her throat and assaulted her. Then he took the gun she kept under her pillow, went to where McCaleb was sleeping and shot him, she said. As the man fled, she said, the two collided, and the intruder dropped the gun. She picked it up and fired two shots after him. Days without a suspect or any new leads stretched into months and years. Nalley said she called the Houston Police Department and the District Attorney’s Office at least once a year for updates. Her tenacity paid off five years ago when two Texas Rangers agreed to look at the case, and then-District Attorney Ken Magidson decided to prosecute. She worked for HPD In 2008, police arrested the widow, who had been a civilian employee at the Houston Police Department as her two sons climbed the ranks as police officers. Prosecutors said the evidence had not changed in the nearly three decades since the killing, but the fresh perspective turned it into a case they believed they could win. Assistant Harris County District Attorney Bill Exley said the lack of new evidence, and because it was important to the victim’s family that Krizan-Wilson admit to murder, meant the plea deal was the right compromise. ''I agree that six months might seem like a light sentence for an intentional killing, but keep in mind that she might not have ever done a day in jail to begin with,'' he said. '' She’s going in and going to serve day for day.'' James Stafford, an attorney for Krizan-Wilson, said the septuagenarian is suffering from dementia and a host of other health issues and wanted to get past the case against her. ''I think this is closure for both sides of the family,'' Stafford said. '' Given her age and medical condition, I think all sides realized this was the just and right decision to make for all of the parties.'' After her 2008 arrest, Krizan-Wilson’s attorneys argued that too much time had passed to indict her, a position that swayed former state District Judge Kevin Fine. dismissed the case, and for five years, it wound its way through the appellate courts. That dismissal was reversed and sent back to the original court. Poignant statement It was a saga that Nalley talked about in the victim’s impact statement she wrote to dress down the killer after the plea. ''Carol, you deserved a much longer and harsher sentence,'' Nalley wrote in the statement. Her daughter had to read the statement in court when Nalley found herself too distraught to address Krizan-Wilson. '' We’ve been failed by the system here on Earth, but one day soon you will be in God’s hands, and he will decide your just punishment for murdering my father.'' Krizan-Wilson appeared stoic as she listened to the words. Nalley said she believes her father was killed for an insurance policy Krizan-Wilson took out months before the shooting. However, she said, the policy was never paid because of suspicions about the death. Nalley said her father was Krizan-Wilson’s seventh husband and that her former stepmother remarried after the slaying. Stafford said Krizan-Wilson and her most recent husband divorced in 1990. Krizan-Wilson was charged with bigamy in 1986, but the case was dismissed. Records showed Krizan-Wilson’s 1976 marriage to Melvin Laxson, whom she divorced in 1987, overlapped with her marriage to McCaleb. Krizan-Wilson did not answer questions from reporters waiting outside the courtroom Wednesday. Instead, she walked out a back door in state District Judge Ryan Patrick’s court and disappeared.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131029.0042", "document": "Dewhurst wants to bill feds for undocumented prisoners Eds: For immediate release. AUSTIN, Texas -- Days after calling for the impeachment of President Barack Obama, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst is demanding that the president pay for the 130,000 undocumented immigrants who are housed in county jails across Texas -- a tab that could run nearly $157 million in the past two years alone. In a letter to Obama, Dewhurst said the federal government should reimburse Texas counties for the cost of housing the undocumented immigrants because the feds have failed to secure the U.S. Mexico border as they should have. ''It’s time we ask for that money back,'' Dewhurst said in an email to supporters this week, asking them to sign a petition supporting his position. '' It’s outrageous that county jails pay for housing to more than 130,000 people that illegally enter our state. ''In my experience, I believe the immigration conversation begins and ends with strict border security, as our counties can no longer fund this massive financial burden.'' In his letter to Obama, Dewhurst wrote: ''The dollars expended in this fashion would be better spent enhancing law enforcement efforts to better protect our citizens.'' No word yet from Washington on what they think of Dewhurst’s demand, but don’t expect a check to be arriving anytime soon. Dewhurst, who has drawn three GOP challengers in his re-election bid, has made a sharp turn to the right in his political rhetoric since losing a U.S. Senate runoff to tea party star Ted Cruz in July 2012. Two weeks ago, Dewhurst publicly advocated Obama’s impeachment at a tea party forum in Fort Worth -- a move that drew surprise since it came from Texas’ No. 2 officeholder. State and county officials have complained for years that detained immigrants are costing local taxpayers, and federal officials have declined to reimburse any costs because the jailed suspects are being held on local charges. Similarly, state officials have also complained that state prisons are holding thousands of undocumented immigrants who were convicted of state crimes. At one point last year, well over 12,000 state convicts had deportation detainers on them -- meaning that as soon as they complete their sentence or are paroled they are subject to being deported, officials said. Most are Mexican citizens, prison officials said. Proposals to deport convicts serving time for nonviolent crimes before they were paroled have failed to gain support from legislative leaders, who feared if they were paroled and returned home they would simply slip back across the border into Texas. The savings from that plan were estimated to be at least $15 million, officials said at the time. Mike Ward writes for the Austin American-Statesman. E-mail: mward(at)statesman.com.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131029.0091", "document": "IKE SKELTON, FORMER CONGRESSMAN FROM MISSOURI, DIES AT 81 Ike Skelton, a Democratic congressman who was ousted in the Republican sweep of 2010 after serving his Missouri district for more than 30 years, died Monday in Arlington, Va. He was 81. His death was confirmed by the law firm Husch Blackwell, where Skelton was a partner. He died at Virginia Hospital Center after a brief illness, according to a statement from his family. Skelton, who was first elected to the House in 1976, was known as an expert on national defense and served as the chairman of House Armed Services Committee from 2007 until leaving office. He was re-elected time and time again in a deeply conservative district that stretches from the Kansas City suburbs to the Ozarks, and he had a long record of supporting two local military institutions: Fort Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base, which he secured as the base for the nation’s fleet of B-2 bombers. “He led an exemplary life of honor, courage and public service,” Maurice Watson, the chairman of Husch Blackwell, said Monday in a statement. “His commitment to our country, the state of Missouri and the men and women who serve our nation in the armed services was unsurpassed.” Skelton was a social conservative who supported gun rights, opposed abortion rights and voted against President Barack Obama’s health care law. Before his defeat, he had not received less than 60 percent of the vote since 1982. But that record was not enough to overcome the national tide of Republicans elected to the House in 2010. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, the Republican who beat Skelton and still holds the seat, received support from many Tea Party members and tied him to Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then the House speaker.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131029.0228", "document": "Scott rejects Bar's lists Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Rick Scott, seeking to bring the court system more in line with his conservative outlook, has repeatedly rejected lists recommended to him by the Florida Bar of lawyers seeking to screen candidates for judgeships. Scott has rejected dozens of attorneys the Bar has nominated to serve on judicial nominating commissions, created decades ago to professionalize the bench and make merit and qualifications at least as important as political connections. ''He wants people with humility,'' says Scott’s chief counsel, Pete Antonacci, ''and he wants judges who will follow the law and not make it up as they go along.'' The Bar said Scott’s two predecessors, Charlie Crist and Jeb Bush, never rejected any of its nominees. All 26 nominating commissions for the trial and appellate courts and the Supreme Court are composed of nine members. Scott appoints five members of his choosing and must appoint four others from lists provided by the Bar’s Board of Governors, some of whom are liberal Democrats who did not support Scott’s election. The governor has rejected the lists 16 times and has never publicly given a reason and is not required to do so. Scott has sent back so many Bar-recommended names that the group keeps a five-page spreadsheet to track them. Lawyers who are registered Democrats, are aligned with left-leaning groups or who promote themselves as trial lawyers appear to have little hope of gaining the governor’s favor. Scott’s list of rejections includes: * Benjamin Crump of Tallahassee, a criminal defense lawyer honored by the NAACP for his legal advocacy and who is best known for his firm’s representation of the family of Trayvon Martin. * Lynn Drysdale, a consumer protection lawyer with Jacksonville Area Legal Aid who has testified before Congress in opposition to state laws that allow payday lenders to target military personnel. * W.C. Gentry, a high-profile trial lawyer in Jacksonville who was a member of the legal ''dream team’' that successfully sued the tobacco industry in the 1990s. A former county school board member, he has generously contributed to Democratic candidates and has given money to Republicans, too. * Tiffany Faddis, a trial lawyer, board member of the trial bar’s statewide lobbying arm, the Florida Justice Association, incoming president of the Hispanic Bar Association of Central Florida and a registered Republican. Antonacci said lawyers with such backgrounds are more likely to have a ''living constitution’' view of the law as evolving and ever-changing, which he said is at odds with Scott’s views. He said he did not know what the Florida Bar’s agenda was in choosing which lawyers to send to Scott, and defended the practice of rejecting Bar names. ''The Florida Bar is not an accountable organization in any electoral way,'' Antonacci said. '' The accountability in the process is with the governor.'' A spokeswoman for the Bar, Francine Walker, said: ''The Florida Bar respects that the governor can reject nominees it submits.'' Deirdre Macnab, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, criticized Scott’s frequent pattern of rejecting Bar-supported lawyers. ''I believe it’s unprecedented,'' Macnab said. '' This is a pretty blatant example of politicizing the court, and citizens should be concerned. … It’s disheartening.'' Macnab serves on a statewide judicial nominating panel for federal judges and was appointed by U.S. Sens. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican. Former Republican state Sen. Alex Villalobos of Miami, president of Democracy at Stake, a bipartisan group that advocates an independent judiciary, said he regretted voting more than a decade ago to weaken the Bar’s role in judicial selection. Prior to that, the Bar had three automatic slots on every JNC. ''That was a mistake,'' he said. '' We’re reaping what we sowed.'' Antonacci said the pace of rejections is likely to quicken, because terms of 78 JNC members are scheduled to expire by June. All 78 were appointed by Scott’s predecessor and likely 2014 opponent, Crist. Since becoming governor in 2011, Scott has appointed more than 100 judges statewide.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131115.0084", "document": "PRISON SENTENCE FOR MANHATTAN FORTUNETELLER NEW YORK - Sylvia Mitchell, the Manhattan fortuneteller whose ornate Greenwich Village parlor and air of uptown sophistication attracted well-to-do, distraught clients who preferred the finer things in life, was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison on Thursday, a month after a jury convicted her of grand larceny. In handing down the sentence, Justice Gregory Carro of state Supreme Court acknowledged that the penalty was harsher than that requested by prosecutors at Thursday’s hearing. The Manhattan district attorney’s office had requested a sentence of three to nine years in prison. “You had a perfect setup,” Carro said. “We have lots of con artists here in New York City,” he said, citing three-card monte dealers and those who pretend their glasses were just broken by a stranger who bumped into them on the street. But Mitchell lured “someone who is having some dramatic stress in their life, some great problems they were going through, looking for some kind of help,” the judge said. Mitchell, 39, began to weep upon entering the courtroom, handcuffed and somewhat haggard after a month in jail on Rikers Island and glimpsing a row of mostly elderly men, presumably relatives, who were sitting with the father of her two teenage children. She told the judge she was sorry for what she had done. “I want to go back to school and start a new profession and start my life again,” she said. She was ordered to pay more than $110,000 in restitution to the two victims in the case, something her lawyer, Kenneth Gribetz, said he came prepared to do with a check from an escrow account. He said he planned to appeal the sentence, which he said was overly harsh given that prosecutors, long before trial, had offered her a plea deal involving no jail time. She refused the offer. Both victims, Lee Choong and Debra Saalfield, wrote letters describing the pain caused by their dealings with Mitchell. Both had approached her during periods of romantic upheaval in their lives. Both testified against Mitchell, and in doing so, admitted that in hindsight, all her talk of curses and evil spirits seemed far-fetched, but at the time, unsettling. Choong said she was drawn to the parlor, called Zena on Seventh Avenue South, because it was plush and relatively pricey. Saalfield said that the news media coverage of the case had further hurt her. At a recent wedding rehearsal dinner that she attended, she wrote, “one of the guests stared at me at great length and put an 'L’ for loser on her face while looking at me.”", "event_args": [{"start": 7, "end": 14, "trigger": "SENTENCE", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "mention": "PRISON", "role": "sentence"}]}, {"start": 256, "end": 264, "trigger": "sentenced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 296, "end": 303, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 327, "end": 335, "trigger": "convicted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 337, "end": 339, "mention": "her", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 379, "end": 386, "trigger": "sentence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 434, "end": 445, "trigger": "acknowledged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 499, "end": 509, "mention": "prosecutors", "role": "prosecutor"}, {"start": 514, "end": 521, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 486, "end": 494, "trigger": "requested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 525, "end": 531, "trigger": "hearing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 514, "end": 521, "mention": "Thursday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 499, "end": 509, "mention": "prosecutors", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 579, "end": 587, "trigger": "requested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 591, "end": 598, "trigger": "sentence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 813, "end": 818, "trigger": "broken", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1081, "trigger": "entering", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1041, "end": 1048, "mention": "Mitchell", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1150, "trigger": "jail", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1041, "end": 1048, "mention": "Mitchell", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1303, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1296, "end": 1298, "mention": "She", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1389, "trigger": "start", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1353, "end": 1353, "mention": "I", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1465, "trigger": "pay", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1444, "end": 1446, "mention": "She", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1572, "end": 1575, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1659, "end": 1664, "trigger": "appeal", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1766, "end": 1768, "mention": "her", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1677, "trigger": "sentence", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1766, "end": 1768, "mention": "her", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1751, "trigger": "trial", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1722, "end": 1732, "mention": "prosecutors", "role": "prosecutor"}]}, {"start": 1795, "end": 1798, "trigger": "jail", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1766, "end": 1768, "mention": "her", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1887, "trigger": "wrote letters", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1967, "trigger": "approached", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1969, "end": 1971, "mention": "her", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 1949, "end": 1952, "mention": "Both", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2030, "end": 2038, "trigger": "testified", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2048, "end": 2055, "mention": "Mitchell", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 2111, "end": 2114, "trigger": "talk", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2107, "end": 2109, "mention": "her", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2438, "end": 2445, "trigger": "attended", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2434, "end": 2436, "mention": "she", "role": "person"}]}]}

The Seminole County sheriff’s office said in a statement that Zimmerman, 30, had been arrested in Apopka, Fla., northwest of Orlando. The authorities did not immediately list the charges against Zimmerman, saying they would release details later. Zimmerman became a national figure after he shot and killed an unarmed Martin, 17, while working as a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., in February 2012. Martin’s death prompted a nationwide outcry against Florida’s self-defense laws, and Zimmerman was ultimately charged with second-degree murder. Zimmerman’s acquittal in July led to renewed protests across the country and increased demands that Florida repeal its Stand Your Ground provision. Since his acquittal, Zimmerman has remained in the news for repeated encounters with law enforcement in Florida and elsewhere. In September, the police in Lake Mary, Fla., investigated a dispute between Zimmerman and his estranged wife, although Zimmerman was not charged. The couple had filed for divorce shortly before that incident, with Shellie Zimmerman accusing George Zimmerman in a television interview of “selfish” behavior.

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131121.0040", "document": "WITH LAST 3 PARDONS, ALABAMA HOPES TO PUT 'SCOTTSBORO BOYS' CASE TO REST REPEATING to add Page 1 coding.) ATLANTA - The state of Alabama posthumously pardoned three black men Thursday who had been falsely convicted more than 80 years ago in the rapes of two white women, absolving the last of the so-called Scottsboro Boys. During a hearing in Montgomery, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles voted unanimously to issue pardons to the three men, Haywood Patterson, Charles Weems and James A. Wright, all of whom were convicted of rape in the 1930s. The case, which yielded two landmark Supreme Court rulings about the inclusion of blacks on juries and the need for adequate legal representation, had continued to hang over Alabama as an enduring mark of its tainted, segregationist past. The last of the men died in 1989. “We’re certainly a different state in the 21st century than we were,” state Sen. Arthur Orr, a sponsor of the legislation that led to the pardons, said in a telephone interview. “Today is the final chapter - and it ends on a brighter note - of a very tragic chapter in our history.” The men were among a group of nine first tried in April 1931 for rape after a fight aboard a train passing through Jackson County, in northeast Alabama. Within three weeks of the fight, an Alabama judge had sentenced eight of the men to death after their convictions by all-white juries. The U.S. Supreme Court intervened the next year and overturned the convictions, setting off a long stretch of additional trials and appeals. Prosecutors dropped the rape charges against five of the men in July 1937, but four others - including the three pardoned Thursday - were convicted again and sentenced to lengthy prison terms or death. State officials ultimately approved paroles for three of them, including Clarence Norris, who received a pardon from Gov. George Wallace in 1976. Patterson, though, escaped from prison and ultimately died in Michigan. Nudged by researchers, the state Legislature earlier this year unanimously supported a measure from Orr and others that allowed the pardons board to act on cases that had not been overturned by the courts or abandoned by prosecutors. “We cannot take back what happened,” Gov. Robert Bentley said in April when he signed the legislation. “But we can make it right moving forward.”", "event_args": [{"start": 12, "end": 18, "trigger": "PARDONS", "subtype": "NA", "arguments":

{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131121.0250", "document": "Ethnic tensions flare at judicial meeting EDNOTES: (FOR USE BY NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE CLIENTS) Tears were shed and Hitler was quoted on Wednesday, as ethnic tensions erupted at the State House and threatened to derail Governor Deval Patrick’s nominee for a seat on the Superior Court. The charged struggle centers around the leadership role that the nominee, Joseph S. Berman, has played in the Anti-Defamation League, a national organization dedicated to combating anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination. Berman’s nomination stirred opposition because, for years, the organization refused to label as genocide the slaughter of Armenians by Ottoman Turks between 1915 and 1923, a stance that angered the Armenian community. But in 2007, the organization reversed course and called the slaughter ''tantamount to genocide,'' quieting the controversy until it flared again around Berman’s nomination. A commercial litigation lawyer from Weston, Berman has been a national commissioner of the organization since 2006, and a member of its regional board and executive committee. At Wednesday’s meeting of the Governor’s Council, the elected eight-member panel that approves judicial nominations, Councilor Marilyn M. Pettito Devaney led the opposition to Berman, saying she had the five votes needed to reject his nomination. Devaney, a Democrat from Watertown, home to a large Armenian community, stood and denounced Berman’s affiliation with the Anti-Defamation League, as the governor looked on, chagrined. ''In 1939, Hitler, carrying out his horrific mission to exterminate the Jews, said, 'Who remembers the Armenians?''' Devaney said, her voice trembling and eyes filling with tears. '' I do. And many others do, too.'' Devaney said if she belonged to ''a group who denied the Holocaust,'' she would resign. Several other councilors agreed that Berman’s ties to the Anti-Defamation League are a concern, while raising their own separate objections. Patrick, who chairsthe Governor’s Council, postponed the vote on Berman’s nomination until Dec. 4, forestalling an embarrassing political defeat. The governor called Berman ''more than ready to serve’' on the Superior Court. ''I’m going to work hard to get the votes,'' Patrick told the councilors. '' I haven’t had an opportunity to do that. I’m not ready today.'' Several councilors strongly objected to the delay and urged Patrick to allow them to vote immediately on Berman’s nomination. ''We’re not going to change our minds,'' Devaney said. '' To prolong this serves no purpose.'' Councilor Terrence W. Kennedy agreed, saying that even though he supports Berman, a delay will not save the nomination. ''It’s a democracy, and I don’t think the vote is going to change,'' he told Patrick. Typically, the lieutenant governor would chair meetings of the council, a fractious and often rebellious panel that dates to the Colonial era. But because Timothy P. Murray resigned as lieutenant governor in May, Patrick has had to fill that role. The fight over Berman’s nomination harkens back to the bitter controversy over the Armenian genocide that engulfed the Anti-Defamation League six years ago. In 2007, the organization fired its New England regional director, Andrew H. Tarsy, after he broke rank with national leadership and said it should acknowledge the genocide. The organization had expressed concern that doing so could harm Israel’s relations with Turkey, a rare Muslim ally. Many Jewish and Armenian leaders in New England criticized Tarsy’s firing and urged the organization to recognize the genocide. After several days of outcry, the national director, Abraham H. Foxman, issued a statement in 2007 calling the massacre of Armenians ''tantamount to genocide’' but stopping short of labeling it an actual genocide. Anti-Defamation League leaders said Wednesday that that phrase is not meant to obscure the historical suffering of Armenians. ''ADL policy right now is crystal clear: that we recognize the Armenian genocide,'' said Robert O. Trestan, director of the New England Anti-Defamation League. '' We’re on the record making that recognition more than five years ago, and we’ve moved on from the issue, and it doesn’t seem appropriate, more than five years later, to bring this up in light of a judicial nomination.'' Reached by phone on Wednesday, Berman declined to discuss the issue. Councilors have also objected to Berman because he donated about $110,000 to Democratic candidates over the last decade, contributions that they say make it appear as though his nomination was a reward for his financial support. In addition, at least one criticized his nomination because he once represented a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay. Jeffrey S. Robbins, the chair of the board of the New England Anti-Defamation League, was among those who testified in support of Berman at his nomination hearing last week. ''The assault on Joe Berman is particularly egregious’' because Berman was one of the most vocal and effective voices within the organization urging it to acknowledge the massacre as a genocide, Robbins said. ''That’s the kind of courage and principle that should be rewarded, and not penalized,'' he said.", "event_args": [{"start": 248, "end": 254, "trigger": "nominee", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 223, "end": 230, "mention": "Governor", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 355, "end": 361, "trigger": "nominee", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 355, "end": 361, "mention": "nominee", "role": "position"}]}, {"start": 529, "end": 538, "trigger": "nomination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 520, "end": 525, "mention": "Berman", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 629, "end": 637, "trigger": "slaughter", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 642, "end": 650, "mention": "Armenians", "role": "target"}]}, {"start": 900, "end": 909, "trigger": "nomination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 891, "end": 896, "mention": "Berman", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1020, "trigger": "since", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 983, "end": 994, "mention": "commissioner", "role": "position"}, {"start": 956, "end": 961, "mention": "Berman", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1109, "trigger": "meeting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1091, "end": 1099, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1332, "trigger": "nomination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1319, "end": 1321, "mention": "his", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1585, "trigger": "exterminate", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1551, "end": 1553, "mention": "his", "role": "attacker"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1527, "mention": "1939", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1594, "mention": "Jews", "role": "target"}]}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1820, "trigger": "resign", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2038, "end": 2047, "trigger": "nomination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2029, "end": 2034, "mention": "Berman", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2242, "end": 2245, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2234, "end": 2240, "mention": "Patrick", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2444, "end": 2453, "trigger": "nomination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2435, "end": 2440, "mention": "Berman", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2659, "end": 2668, "trigger": "nomination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2625, "end": 2630, "mention": "Berman", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2804, "end": 2811, "trigger": "meetings", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2930, "end": 2937, "trigger": "resigned", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2965, "end": 2967, "mention": "May", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2989, "end": 2992, "trigger": "fill", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2965, "end": 2967, "mention": "May", "role": "time"}, {"start": 2970, "end": 2976, "mention": "Patrick", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3029, "end": 3038, "trigger": "nomination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3020, "end": 3025, "mention": "Berman", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3097, "end": 3104, "trigger": "genocide", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3088, "end": 3095, "mention": "Armenian", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 3188, "end": 3192, "trigger": "fired", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3165, "end": 3168, "mention": "2007", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 3519, "end": 3524, "trigger": "firing", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3511, "end": 3515, "mention": "Tarsy", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3652, "end": 3669, "trigger": "issued a statement", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3674, "end": 3677, "mention": "2007", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 3691, "end": 3698, "trigger": "massacre", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3674, "end": 3677, "mention": "2007", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 3992, "end": 3999, "trigger": "genocide", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3983, "end": 3990, "mention": "Armenian", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 4314, "end": 4318, "trigger": "phone", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4334, "end": 4339, "mention": "Berman", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 4323, "end": 4331, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 4423, "end": 4429, "trigger": "donated", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4437, "end": 4444, "mention": "$110,000", "role": "money"}, {"start": 4420, "end": 4421, "mention": "he", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 4550, "end": 4559, "trigger": "nomination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4546, "end": 4548, "mention": "his", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 4642, "end": 4651, "trigger": "nomination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4638, "end": 4640, "mention": "his", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 4817, "end": 4825, "trigger": "testified", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 4855, "end": 4864, "trigger": "nomination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4851, "end": 4853, "mention": "his", "role": "person"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131122.0237", "document": "Toronto mayor Rob Ford has a saner side EDNOTES: (FOR USE BY NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE CLIENTS) The Boston Globe Lawrence Harmon can be reached at harmon@globe.com © 2013 The New York Times Boston Mayor Tom Menino turned down a bet last May with Toronto Mayor Rob Ford on the outcome of a Bruins-Maple Leafs hockey playoff series. Apparently Menino can smell a troublemaker 429 miles away. Since that time, Ford has imploded. A video of the out-of-control mayor smoking crack has fallen into the hands of police. A photo of Ford consorting with suspected gang members has been posted on the Internet. A video shows him in full rant threatening to rip out the throat and poke out the eyes of some real or imagined political enemy. He admits to driving under the influence of alcohol. And on Monday, the 300-pound Ford pancaked Pam McConnell, a petite city councilor, in his rush to confront jeering members of the public in Toronto’s council chamber. Ford could benefit from some time in what psychiatrists politely refer to as a therapeutic milieu. And if his rampages continue at the current level, the milieu might need to come equipped with a tranquilizer dart gun and an ample supply of leg and arm restraints. Ford is hardly the first mayor to go wild in office. Yet there is no method to his madness, unlike the seemingly bizarre actions of other municipal leaders. Take the case of Vilnius Mayor Arturas Zuokas. In 2011, he commandeered an armored personnel carrier and crushed a Mercedes Benz that was illegally parked in a bike lane in the Lithuanian capital. Over the top? Sure. But Zuokas’s action showed creativity and civic spirit in a way that smoking crack cocaine never could. Reykjavik Mayor Jon Gnarr favors Jedi robes as office wear. Last year, he rode through the streets of the Icelandic capital wearing a pink dress and mouthing the lyrics to songs by Pussy Riot, an all-female Russian punk band whose leader was locked up in Siberia after a musical protest. Unusual fashion choices? Maybe. But Gnarr succeeded at drawing attention to the plight of political dissidents. Ford’s antics only draw attention to himself. Toronto’s city council has stripped Ford of his substantive duties. And there are calls for provincial officials to intervene and remove Ford by amending the charter of Canada’s largest city. But the current cuckooness glosses over how Ford managed to convince voters to elect him to the mayor’s seat back in 2010. His proclivity for erratic behavior and boorishness was already known from his days serving on the city council. The answer, it turns out, speaks volumes about the deepest concern of many city dwellers -- waste in government. During the campaign, Ford impressed voters with his promise to ''end the gravy train’' of runaway spending by a progressive city administration. Toronto Life columnist Philip Preville and others have pointed out that the newly elected Ford made good on that promise. Ford aligned himself with fiscal conservatives, dissolved the board of the city’s incompetent housing authority, outsourced much of the city’s trash collection, trimmed the city budget, and negotiated union contracts that didn’t soak Toronto taxpayers. He also takes a keen interest in finding solutions to residents’ problems -- and takes their calls personally. ''Are you aware that 2,200 people call me?'' he demanded of critics who are calling for his resignation. Even while  fighting -- unsuccessfully -- with his personal demons, Ford manages to keep a count of constituent calls. City dwellers will put up with a lot of nonsense from any mayor who takes tight fiscal control of the city and responds to them personally. Not as much nonsense as Ford is dishing out, mind you. But a lot. Author Benjamin Barber cites the prominent features of a successful urban mayor in his new book, ''If Mayors Ruled the World.'' Chief among them is ''a preference for pragmatism and problem solving over ideology and principled grandstanding.'' Ford, for all his problems, fits that definition. Perhaps there is a lesson here for Boston Mayor-elect Marty Walsh. Walsh is the personal antithesis of Ford: sober, thoughtful, and discerning. He is a man of principle -- a self-professed ''son of labor’' who ''will wear my record of fighting for working people as a badge of honor.'' Yet 48 percent of voters rejected Walsh in the recent election, many of then fearful that his close ties to organized labor would translate into bloated public payrolls and higher property taxes. Even in Boston -- with its Puritan roots -- many residents might be tempted to opt for a wild man who respects their wallets over a fastidious gentleman who doesn’t.", "event_args": [{"start": 531, "end": 540, "trigger": "consorting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 526, "end": 529, "mention": "Ford", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 649, "end": 651, "trigger": "rip", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 617, "end": 619, "mention": "him", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 819, "end": 826, "trigger": "pancaked", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 814, "end": 817, "mention": "Ford", "role": "attacker"}, {"start": 792, "end": 797, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 875, "end": 878, "trigger": "rush", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 925, "end": 931, "mention": "Toronto", "role": "place"}, {"start": 792, "end": 797, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 883, "end": 890, "trigger": "confront", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 871, "end": 873, "mention": "his", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 792, "end": 797, "mention": "Monday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1444, "trigger": "commandeered", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1430, "end": 1431, "mention": "he", "role": "recipient"}, {"start": 1424, "end": 1427, "mention": "2011", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1485, "trigger": "crushed", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1424, "end": 1427, "mention": "2011", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1560, "mention": "Lithuanian", "role": "place"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1431, "mention": "he", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1772, "trigger": "rode", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1766, "end": 1767, "mention": "he", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1937, "end": 1945, "trigger": "locked up", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1926, "end": 1931, "mention": "leader", "role": "person"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1956, "mention": "Siberia", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1980, "trigger": "protest", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1926, "end": 1931, "mention": "leader", "role": "person"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1956, "mention": "Siberia", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 2271, "end": 2276, "trigger": "remove", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2278, "end": 2281, "mention": "Ford", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 2412, "end": 2416, "trigger": "elect", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2418, "end": 2420, "mention": "him", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2402, "end": 2407, "mention": "voters", "role": "agent"}, {"start": 2450, "end": 2453, "mention": "2010", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2780, "end": 2787, "trigger": "spending", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2909, "end": 2915, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2917, "end": 2920, "mention": "Ford", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 3139, "end": 3148, "trigger": "negotiated", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3191, "end": 3199, "trigger": "taxpayers", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3295, "end": 3299, "trigger": "calls", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3202, "end": 3203, "mention": "He", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 3289, "end": 3293, "mention": "their", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3347, "end": 3350, "trigger": "call", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3352, "end": 3353, "mention": "me", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3405, "end": 3415, "trigger": "resignation", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 3530, "end": 3534, "trigger": "calls", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3518, "end": 3528, "mention": "constituent", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3648, "end": 3655, "trigger": "responds", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3660, "end": 3663, "mention": "them", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 4085, "end": 4089, "trigger": "elect", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4072, "end": 4077, "mention": "Boston", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 4377, "end": 4384, "trigger": "election", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4370, "end": 4375, "mention": "recent", "role": "time"}, {"start": 4357, "end": 4361, "mention": "Walsh", "role": "person"}]}]}

On Wednesday, an estimated crowd of 10,000 poured into Rabin Square, the Tel Aviv plaza named for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, where Einstein’s coffin lay in state. His rendition of a modern Israeli ballad, “Cry for You,” became one of the motifs of the period after Rabin’s assassination in 1995. “His songs accompanied us at all the stations of our lives - in our loves and disappointments, our ups and downs,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a memorial ceremony in the square, adding that Einstein symbolized “the land of Israel that is beautiful, true and pure.” Einstein, who began his recording career in the 1960s, released nearly 50 albums, sometimes in collaboration with other artists. While he largely retired from the stage several decades ago and was little known internationally, his popularity at home barely waned. Last year he was voted best Israeli singer of all time by readers of the popular newspaper Yediot Aharonot. Einstein helped forge an authentic Hebrew rock culture with popular songs like “Me and You” and “Fly, Baby Bird.” “His sound was new,” Motti Regev, an Israeli sociologist specializing in popular music and culture, told Israel Radio on Wednesday. “Israeli music was mostly connected to military bands and ideological music. He sought how to connect to popular music in the world, to rock, and connect it to what was taking place in Israel.” Einstein’s music, crossing generations and ethnic boundaries, was a comforting and unifying force in a diverse and often divided country, and the embodiment of an older, more genteel Israel that some say does not exist anymore. He was also known for his appearances in movies and comedy skits. Arieh Einstein was born in Tel Aviv on Jan. 3, 1939, the only child of Yaakov and Devorah Einstein. His father was an actor. He became Israel’s high-jump champion as a boy and performed his military service as a member of an infantry brigade entertainment troupe. He married Alona Shochet in 1963, and they had two daughters. The couple divorced, remarried and divorced again. She died in 2006. Einstein had two more children, a son and a daughter, with his second wife, Sima Eliyahu, an actress. She and his four children survive him. Described by friends and acquaintances as modest and bashful, Einstein stopped performing for live audiences in the early 1980s after being seriously injured in a car accident. Although he continued recording, he largely retired from the public eye in recent years. But the newspaper Maariv announced this week that Einstein would begin writing a weekly column for its weekend supplement. He had put the final touches on his first - and last - column in the hours before he died.", "event_args": [{"start": 39, "end": 42, "trigger": "DIES", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 230, "end": 233, "trigger": "died", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 235, "end": 241, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 110, "end": 114, "mention": "whose", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 271, "end": 275, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 267, "end": 269, "mention": "His", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 305, "end": 313, "trigger": "announced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 267, "end": 269, "mention": "His", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 404, "end": 408, "trigger": "taken", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 391, "end": 398, "mention": "Einstein", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 678, "end": 688, "trigger": "poured into", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 638, "end": 646, "mention": "Wednesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 911, "end": 923, "trigger": "assassination", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 903, "end": 907, "mention": "Rabin", "role": "victim"}, {"start": 928, "end": 931, "mention": "1995", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2338, "end": 2341, "trigger": "born", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2586, "end": 2592, "trigger": "married", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2583, "end": 2584, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2614, "mention": "1963", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2663, "trigger": "divorced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2666, "end": 2674, "trigger": "remarried", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2680, "end": 2687, "trigger": "divorced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2703, "trigger": "died", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2708, "end": 2711, "mention": "2006", "role": "time"}, {"start": 2696, "end": 2698, "mention": "She", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 3005, "end": 3011, "trigger": "injured", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2917, "end": 2924, "mention": "Einstein", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 3146, "end": 3154, "trigger": "announced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3139, "end": 3144, "mention": "Maariv", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 3329, "end": 3332, "trigger": "died", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 3256, "end": 3257, "mention": "he", "role": "victim"}]}]}

It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow’s New York Times.) LONDON - Two Italians sisters who spent more than $1 million on celebrity chef Nigella Lawson’s credit cards were acquitted of fraud charges Friday by a London jury. The sisters, Francesca, 35, and Elisabetta Grillo, 41, testified that Lawson had given them permission to spend as they liked on the household credit cards in exchange for keeping quiet about her cocaine use. Lawson, 53, was compelled under oath to admit to using cocaine after now former husband, Charles Saatchi, 70, called her “Higella” in a private email that was revealed in court. He later said he regretted the email and never saw her using drugs, but she accused him of “intimate terrorism” and intense jealousy, and with trying to destroy her reputation. The couple divorced in July after he was photographed squeezing her nose and gripping her by the throat at a London restaurant. That incident and the fraud case involving the private life of the celebrity chef provided much fodder for Britain’s tabloids. Lawson denied abusing drugs, testifying that she first used cocaine while caring for her first husband, John Diamond, when he was terminally ill with cancer; he died in 2001. After the verdict, Lawson said in a statement, “I did my civic duty, only to be maliciously vilified without the right to respond.” Prosecutors told the court that over just four months in 2012, the sisters spent thousands of dollars in personal charges on household credit cards, including trips to New York, hotel stays and designer leather goods, as well as clothes from labels such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Vivienne Westwood. Neither sister was in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Elisabetta Grillo apparently suffered a panic attack in court Thursday and collapsed three times Friday, once in the courthouse. The Grillos were each charged with a single count of fraud. The sisters were described by one of their lawyers, Richard Cannon, as “naturally relieved” by the verdict.", "event_args": [{"start": 26, "end": 41, "trigger": "FOUND NOT GUILTY", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 210, "end": 214, "trigger": "spent", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 290, "end": 298, "trigger": "acquitted", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 317, "end": 322, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 309, "end": 315, "trigger": "charges", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 317, "end": 322, "mention": "Friday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 303, "end": 307, "mention": "fraud", "role": "crime"}, {"start": 329, "end": 334, "mention": "London", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 397, "end": 405, "trigger": "testified", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 448, "end": 452, "trigger": "spend", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 412, "end": 417, "mention": "Lawson", "role": "giver"}, {"start": 429, "end": 432, "mention": "them", "role": "recipient"}]}, {"start": 624, "end": 637, "trigger": "former husband", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 606, "end": 612, "mention": "cocaine", "role": "thing"}, {"start": 551, "end": 556, "mention": "Lawson", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 695, "end": 699, "trigger": "email", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 668, "end": 670, "mention": "her", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 738, "end": 741, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 729, "end": 730, "mention": "He", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 760, "end": 764, "trigger": "email", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 743, "end": 744, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 917, "end": 924, "trigger": "divorced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 929, "end": 932, "mention": "July", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 983, "end": 990, "trigger": "gripping", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 970, "end": 972, "mention": "her", "role": "target"}, {"start": 907, "end": 908, "mention": "he", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1065, "trigger": "case", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1199, "trigger": "testifying", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1161, "end": 1166, "mention": "Lawson", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1325, "trigger": "died", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1330, "end": 1333, "mention": "2001", "role": "time"}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1208, "mention": "he", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1380, "trigger": "statement", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1355, "end": 1360, "mention": "Lawson", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1483, "trigger": "told", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1468, "end": 1478, "mention": "Prosecutors", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1547, "trigger": "spent", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1631, "trigger": "trips", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1992, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2017, "end": 2021, "mention": "fraud", "role": "crime"}]}]}
{"doc_id": "NYT_ENG_20131225.0200", "document": "Ghost haunts pardon process ALBANY, N.Y. – While Christmas marks a traditional time during which governors commute the sentences of a handful of prisoners, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has granted none since taking office in 2011. As of Tuesday, Cuomo has given no commutations, in which prisoners are released; or pardons, in which convictions are nullified. That’s in contrast with the previous four governors, including Cuomo’s father, Mario M. Cuomo. The elder Cuomo, Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson all granted clemency during their terms as governor. Andrew Cuomo hasn’t closed the door on the idea, but he’s made no promises. When asked if any clemency was forthcoming this year, spokesman Richard Azzopardi said that ''all requests are reviewed.'' There doesn’t appear to be a public outcry over clemencies, and a governor can grant them at any time. But reform activists have taken note of the lack of action. '' Every year, I ask him to use his power of executive clemency. He has not used any yet,'' said Anthony Papa, spokesman for the Drug Policy Alliance, which pushes to reform drug laws. ''Historically, other governors have done this around Christmas,'' added John O’Hara, a Brooklyn lawyer who was convicted of voter fraud in a convoluted case involving a battle he had with the borough’s Democratic machine. He has since regained his ability to practice law, but continues to seek a pardon for his felony conviction. Papa, who was serving time on a drug conviction and was granted a commutation by former Gov. George Pataki, said he believes Cuomo, like some other politicians, has been influenced by the ''Willie Horton Syndrome,'' which dates to the 1980s. Horton was serving a life term for murder in Massachusetts when he left prison under a furlough and committed an armed robbery and rape. Michael Dukakis was governor of Massachusetts at the time and George H.W. Bush’s campaign exploited the Horton incident to make Dukakis, a Democrat, look soft on crime during the 1988 presidential race. Bush, a Republican, won. Papa believes Cuomo worries that if a commutation were to turn out badly, it could come back to haunt him, possibly in a presidential contest down the road. ''The Democrats have been scared,'' agreed Jim Murphy, a former jail chaplain and Capital Region prison-reform activist. '' They are more vulnerable to the tough-on-crime talk.'' Cuomo’s Democratic predecessors, though, have given commutations and pardons. David Paterson granted three commutations and 35 pardons; Eliot Spitzer granted one pardon. Republican Gov. George Pataki gave 32 commutations, largely for Rockefeller Drug Law cases, and one posthumous pardon to comedian Lenny Bruce. Democrat Mario Cuomo gave 37 commutations and Hugh Carey, who served through 1982 (pre-Willie Horton) gave 155 commutations and pardons. rkarlin(at)timesunion.com - 518-454-5758 - Twitter:

{"doc_id": "XIN_ENG_20101125.0137", "document": "Domestic News Industry economics Africa Kenya IFC Insurance IFC signs deal to expand insurance to farmers in East Africa IFC signs deal to expand insurance to farmers in East Africa NAIROBI, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- International Finance Corporation (IFC) has signed agreements with three partners to expand access to insurance to thousands of farmers and livestock herders in Kenya and Rwanda to help protect their crops, animals and livelihoods from weather-related risks and natural disasters. IFC, through the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF), will confer grants totaling roughly 4.1 million U. S. dollars to the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture/UAP Insurance weather index insurance initiative in Kenya; the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Livestock index insurance project in northern Kenya; and the MicroEnsure weather index insurance project in Rwanda. \"These partnerships highlight IFC's commitment to expanding insurance and other financial products where they are needed most in Africa. The Global Index Insurance Facility will facilitate farmers' access to credit, leading to increased productivity, improved livelihoods and greater food security,\" Jean Philippe Prosper, IFC Director for Eastern and Southern Africa said.   \" We are grateful to the donors that have generously provided funding and to our partners for supporting this program. The grants, the first three provided under the GIIF program, will help bring weather-related, index-based insurance to about 35, 000 farmers and 5,000 livestock herders in East Africa over the next three years. \"The implementation of these three first GIIF projects in Kenya and Rwanda will support the development of new insurance products and will increase expertise in this field, which will benefit smallholders and livestock keepers affected by climatic events,\" he said. \"In addition to the GIIF, the European Union is providing further financing to the ILRI Livestock Insurance project in Kenya through the 10th European Development Fund, Kenya Rural Development Project that will start in 2011.\" IFC will confer a grant of up to 2.4 million dollars on Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture, which expects to help insure 20,000 farmers in Kenya over the next three years IFC will confer a grant of up to 154,000 dollars on the ILRI, which expects to help insure 5,000 livestock herders in northern Kenya over the next two years. IFC will confer a grant of up to 1.6 million dollars on MicroEnsure, which expects to insure 15,000 farmers in Rwanda over the next three years. IFC's GIIF program was established in 2009 to assist the development of index-based insurance for natural disasters and weather risks in developing countries, where insurance is rarely available. The grants will fund advisory activities, including local capacity building, infrastructure development, product development, and development of local insurance companies' capacity to provide index-based insurance products. Index-based insurance insures against catastrophic events, such as wind storms or droughts, depending on their severity.

When she replied she seemed nice and the photo given was a gorgous young lady. Ater a few exchanges of emails my friend decided he wanted to meet however there was a catch. She had no money for the flight. It would cost £450 + £50 transfer by western union. Anyway blinded by love or lust he sent the money. Unfortunately that was not the last he heard from her because she said she will come over christmas. My friend embarked on a shopping spree. Pressies and doing up the bedroom to make it their love nest. He then got an email saying she needed to prove to immigration that she could support herself. She needed $1500 or £900. He was dubious but checked with a someone eastern european he was acquainted with, who convinced him it was possible. Anyway he promptly wired the money over to her. The day before she was supposed to arrive she got an email. It said she was on the train after visiting the bank when she was mugged. She needed more money. By this time my friend was desperate to meet her. Without a thought he paid her. I think you can guess what happened. Did she show up for Christmas?? My friend is one of the nicest guys you can meet. He has been unlucky in love and has 2 small children. Although sex was probably at the front of his mind I think he genuinely was looking for a companion. He has learnt a valuable less extremely expensively Too late now, but another variant on advance fee fraud (google for this and/or 419 scam). Most of them hit one or more of the 7 deadly sins, and there are that many photo's and documents available on t'web these days. He's far from being the only one by the way - these scams rake in several BILLION each year. This is the classic foreighn bride scam - your friend was probably not even communicating with a women at all. Golden Rule is never to send money topeople you don't know and have never met. Remember, Mishka on Neighbours turned up and was a very amazing Russian bride. I'm sure there are good offers out there. im sorry but i have no sympathy at all for him. surely he has read and heard these stories before. how many times did he send money??? id have understood a tad if only once but 3 times, come on, get a grip. These scams happen because people are stupid enough to belive them. dont tell me when you first read the post you first thought wasnt \"he hasnt really fallen for that\" tut tut tut, maybe next time he will learn when he gets an email saying he's won the spanish lottery, all he needs to do is send 1000 to release the money!!!! LOL There is no way a Russian women can get a VISA to visit the UK on her own simply as a tourist - she would need a UK sponsor, and the VISA would be a fiancee VISA, not a tourist VISA. Someone posted a story very similar to this on the moneysaving marriages forum over xmas. It involved her Dad. Similar thing, she was mugged etc and he had to send more money, but this one did turn up over here. Ill see if I can find the thread. **edit** Found the thread: Quote: There is no way a Russian women can get a VISA to visit the UK on her own simply as a tourist - she would need a UK sponsor, and the VISA would be a fianc!e VISA, not a tourist VISA. You need to check that. It actually depends on the status of the lady in her own country, but yes she would still need a sponsor. MY sons girlfriend is Thai, she qualifies in her own right for a tourist visa and doesn't need a fianc! visa. Fianc! visa means you have to marry in 60 or 90 days a tourist visa gives you 6 - 12 months in the UK This scam used to be the the Thai lady British passport scam. The bit where this is hard to believe is where you say he \"checked with someone Eastern european he was aquainted with\". Er. did he not run this by anyone else. cos wouldnt 99% have said nooooo. Is anyone else always suspicious of posts which involve much foolishness supposedly happening to 'a friend'. Don't get me wrong - I do feel sorry for the person it happened to - if only for the obvious loneliness which drove a man to the point where all reason flies out of the window but wasn't it a wise woman (or man) who said that God gave Man a brain and a p***s but not enough blood to run both of them at the same time!!!!

{"doc_id": "bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8803193", "document": "2 Border Patrol Agents: 12 years in Prison for wounding Illegal Alien Drug Smuggler WHAT a crock of horseshit...I heard this on the radio this morning, and found this link: Two U.S. Border Patrol agents were sentenced to prison terms of 11 years and 12 years for shooting a drug-smuggling suspect in the buttocks as he fled across the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Cardone in El Paso, Texas, sentenced Jose Alonso Compean to 12 years in prison and Ignacio Ramos to 11 years and one day despite a plea by their attorney for a new trial after three jurors said they were coerced into voting guilty in the case, the Washington Times reported. As WorldNetDaily reported, a federal jury convicted Compean, 28, and Ramos, 37, in March after a two-week trial on charges of causing serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon, discharge of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence and a civil rights violation. Ramos is an eight-year veteran of the U.S. Naval Reserve and a former nominee for Border Patrol Agent of the Year. On Feb. 17, he responded to a request for back up from Compean, who noticed a suspicious van near the levee road along the Rio Grande River near the Texas town of Fabens, about 40 miles east of El Paso. Ramos, who headed toward Fabens hoping to cut off the van, soon joined a third agent already in pursuit. Behind the wheel of the van was an illegal alien, Osbaldo Aldrete-Davila of Mexico. Unknown to the growing number of Border Patrol agents converging on Fabens, Aldrete-Davila's van was carrying 800 pounds of marijuana. Unable to outrun Ramos and the third agent, Aldrete-Davila stopped the van on the levee, jumped out and started running toward the river. When he reached the other side of the levee, he was met by Compean who had anticipated the smuggler's attempt to get back to Mexico. \"We both yelled out for him to stop, but he wouldn't stop, and he just kept running,\" Ramos told California's Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. Aldrete-Davila crossed a canal. \"At some point during the time where I'm crossing the canal, I hear shots being fired,\" Ramos said. \"Later, I see Compean on the ground, but I keep running after the smuggler.\" At that point, Ramos said, Aldrete-Davila turned toward him, pointing what looked like a gun. \"I shot,\" Ramos said. \"But I didn't think he was hit, because he kept running into the brush and then disappeared into it. Later, we all watched as he jumped into a van waiting for him. He seemed fine. It didn't look like he had been hit at all. The commotion and multiple calls for back up had brought seven other agents  including two supervisors  to the crossing by this time. Compean picked up his shell casings, but Ramos did not. He also did not follow agency procedure and report that he had fired his weapon. \"The supervisors knew that shots were fired,\" Ramos told the paper. \"Since nobody was injured or hurt, we didn't file the report. That's the only thing I would've done different. Had he done that one thing differently, it's unlikely it would have mattered to prosecutors. More than two weeks after the incident,(emphasis mine) Christopher Sanchez, an investigator with the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, received a call from a Border Patrol agent in Wilcox, Ariz. The agent's mother-in-law had received a call from Aldrete-Davila's mother in Mexico telling her that her son had been wounded in the buttocks in the shooting. Sanchez followed up with a call of his own to the smuggler in Mexico. In a move that still confuses Ramos and Compean, the U.S. government filed charges against them after giving full immunity to Aldrete-Davila and paying for his medical treatment at an El Paso hospital. At trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Kanof told the court that the agents had violated an unarmed Aldrete-Davila's civil rights. \"The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled it is a violation of someone's Fourth Amendment rights to shoot them in the back while fleeing if you don't know who they are and/or if you don't know they have a weapon,\" said Kanof. Kanof dismissed Ramos' testimony that he had seen something shiny in the smuggler's hand, saying that the agent couldn't be sure it was a gun he had seen. Further, Kanof argued, it was a violation of Border Patrol policy for agents to pursue fleeing suspects. \"Agents are not allowed to pursue. In order to exceed the speed limit, you have to get supervisor approval, and they did not,\" she told the Daily Bulletin. Those shell casings Compean picked up were described to the jury as destroying the crime scene and their failure to file an incident report  punishable by a five-day suspension, according to Border Patrol regulations  an attempted cover up. The Texas jury came back with a guilty verdict. Conviction for discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence has an automatic 10-year sentence. The other counts have varying punishments. \"How are we supposed to follow the Border Patrol strategy of apprehending terrorists or drug smugglers if we are not supposed to pursue fleeing people?\" said Ramos, who noted that he only did on that day what he had done for the previous 10 years. \"Everybody who's breaking the law flees from us. What are we supposed to do? Do they want us to catch them or not? He also noted that none of the other agents who had responded to the incident filed reports that shots were fired and, besides, both supervisors at the scene knew they had discharged their weapons. \"You need to tell a supervisor because you can't assume that a supervisor knows about it,\" Kanof countered. \"You have to report any discharge of a firearm.\" \"This is the greatest miscarriage of justice I have ever seen,\" said Andy Ramirez of the nonprofit group Friends of the Border Patrol. \"This drug smuggler has fully contributed to the destruction of two brave agents and their families and has sent a very loud message to the other Border Patrol agents: If you confront a smuggler, this is what will happen to you.\" The El Paso Sheriff's Department increased its patrols around the Ramos home when the family received threats from people they believed were associated with Aldrete-Davila. Bewildering how ANYONE could bring these charges to begin with, much LESS hand down the ruling that this judge &amp; jury made. Where is the Presidential Pardon at? Where is the Presidential Pardon at? Unless you are a VIP, you have to actually be in prison before you would be considered for a pardon.

This will be appealed on these grounds and probably thrown out. A Judge that would let this verdict stand should be impeached. I guess when real border security is taken seriously then real border security can be achieved:nine: saw this on Glenn Beck the other night. I have to have hope in the appeals process that these guys will never goto actually prison. three jurors said they were coerced into voting guilty in the case How were these jurors \"coerced\"? The drug cartels are obviously very powerful and dangerous. Who knows? maybe the judge was also \"coerced\"?

Of course the boarder patrol officers will still be in jail.:talk2: I think killing him is good enough. Dead men don't press charges. But ballistics DO convict. Where is the Presidential Pardon at?

And these guys should have been given a citation for doing more than their jobs, while she should have been given a life sentence. She knew it, which is why she celebrated the sentencing. Bush \"could have\" said something about this case, and maybe imposed some influence. But NOOOOOoooooo. Bush is in some kind of sick fucking LOVE fest with mexico, and all for protecting illegal aliens. Bush should be tried for treason for the way he's ignored the tidal wave of illegal mexican invaders into our country, and then wanting to give them all a free pass, better known as \"amnesty\". The border patrol agents should have been given meritorious service medals and sent back out on patrol. I hope their case is appealed and they win.

I agree......not at the eleventh hour of your Presidency as William Jefferson Clinton did. I don't think he can pardon them until they've been in jail for a year or so, at least, traditionally that's been the policy, at least until Clinton got involved. But that was different, since he got several blow jobs from Rich's ex in return. Personally, i'd favor knee-capping the smuggler and dropping his sorry ass far out in the desert.

{"doc_id": "bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6850348", "document": "A friend in need is a pest WASHINGTON - Former White House aide I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison Tuesday for lying and obstructing the CIA leak investigation. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, stood calmly before a packed courtroom as a federal judge said the evidence overwhelmingly proved his guilt and left the courthouse without commenting. \"People who occupy these types of positions, where they have the welfare and security of nation in their hands, have a special obligation to not do anything that might create a problem,\" U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton said. Walton did not set a date for Libby to report to prison. Though he saw no reason to let Libby remain free pending appeal, Walton said he would accept written arguments on the issue and rule later. Deputy White House press secretary Dana Perino, accompanying President Bush on Air Force One from the Czech Republic to Germany Tuesday, told reporters that Bush \"felt terrible for the family, especially for his wife and kids.\" She said Bush would comment no further on the case at this time. Got him in the can at last. Looks like Scooter will serve some time. The judge is not likely to grant bond while an appeal is filed. There is a lot of scuttlebutt in my local rag about Bush possibly pardoning him. To do so, IMO would be a travesty. Well I feel sorry for his wife and kids too but if you do the crime you should pay the time. I hope President Bush does not give him a pardon. Scooter Scooter got his knickers twisted because he arrogantly thought he and his ilk were above the law. BBB Well I feel sorry for his wife and kids too but if you do the crime you should pay the time. I hope President Bush does not give him a pardon. I am sure that there are many men in jails with wives, kids, sick mothers and lonely pets. That is not a reason for absolving a person from taking his just punishment. Phoenix32890 I am slightly confused on your post. You quoted me and I am not quite sure why since I feel there should not be a pardon. Well I feel sorry for his wife and kids too but if you do the crime you should pay the time. I hope President Bush does not give him a pardon. I am sure that there are many men in jails with wives, kids, sick mothers and lonely pets. That is not a reason for absolving a person from taking his just punishment. That certainly isn't a reason in Scooter's case, but I disagree that it's never the case. I served on a jury in which an illegal from Mexico chose to drink 21 beers and then go for a drive (on the wrong side of the road) resulting in a head-on collision which in turn changed the lives of the family in the other car forever (grandmother blinded, 2-year old's chest crushed). The prosecutors wanted to throw the book at him, but we gave him probation because he had a wife and 3 teenagers to support (with the provision that if he was caught driving drunk again he'd serve out his 10-year prison sentence, period).

The prosecutors wanted to throw the book at him, but we gave him probation because he had a wife and 3 teenagers to support (with the provision that if he was caught driving drunk again he'd serve out his 10-year prison sentence, period). Since when does a jury do the sentencing for a crime? That is what the judge does. All a jury does is find the person innocent or guilty. The judge sentences the person. Bush has to pardon him. You all can continue to think with your emotions but this isn't a right/wrong issue. It's a political issue. Bush had to pardon him or risk his other allies turning on him for fear their butt isn't covered. bush has gotten away with it and will leave office scott free, unaccountable and filthy rich. WTF does he care about political allies? bush has gotten away with it and will leave office scott free, unaccountable and filthy rich. WTF does he care about political allies? Oh I am sure he is already rich He will get pardoned. I'm so sure he'll be pardoned that if he doesn't, I promise to take a belt sander to my own nipples until they are nothing but raw, pink, wet patches on my chest. He will get pardoned. I'm so sure he'll be pardoned that if he doesn't, I promise to take a belt sander to my own nipples until they are nothing but raw, pink, wet patches on my chest. stop teasing you....

Since when does a jury do the sentencing for a crime? it appears they do in U.S. death penalty cases In a bifurcated trial, the jury would first determine guilt or innocence, and then, if the defendant were found guilty, the appropriate sentence, a life term or death. U.S. courts link In most states, the court holds a sentencing hearing for felony convictions and convictions that can lead to incarceration. This hearing is usually held several days or weeks after delivery of the verdict and can consist of oral testimony, cross-examination of witnesses, evidence, and arguments to the sentencing authority (either the judge or the jury).

U.S. courts link And noncapital cases, as well. a/t some commentators libby will likely be able to stay out of jail for \"a while\" - several months ? he might serve a very short jail sentence and receive a pardon towards the end of president bush' term. all guesswork, of course. hbg a/t some commentators libby will likely be able to stay out of jail for \"a while\" - several months ? he might serve a very short jail sentence and receive a pardon towards the end of president bush' term. all guesswork, of course. hbg If Walton denies him bond, then he'll report in 45-60 days.

I was referring to the initial trial phase when the jury finds the defendent guilty or innocent. Great link btw. I still hope President Bush does not give a pardon. Bush has to pardon him. You all can continue to think with your emotions but this isn't a right/wrong issue. It's a political issue. Bush had to pardon him or risk his other allies turning on him for fear their butt isn't covered. I realize it is a political issue. What is to be gained by a pardon if the President will soon be out of office?

Emery's extradition hearing in Vancouver was adjourned on Wednesday so his lawyer could negotiate a deal with the U.S. district attorney in which Emery could spend up to eight years in jail for one charge, while two other more serious charges are dropped, he said. \"I will be making a guilty plea to one count of marijuana distribution this summer, and then when I'm sentenced the U.S. district attorney is going to be asking for five to eight years in a federal U.S. penitentiary,\" he told CBC News on Wednesday. After the guilty plea, Emery expects he will be sentenced in August or September and is hoping he will eventually be transferred to a Canadian jail. Joint U.S.-Canada bust This is not the first time the marijuana activist has said his lawyers are cutting a deal with U.S. prosecutors. In July 2008, Emery said he had made a deal in which he would serve a minimum of five years in jail, but he later blamed Canadian authorities when the deal fell through. The marijuana activist is facing drug charges for selling pot seeds to U.S. customers, after his Vancouver-based mail order business was busted in a joint operation involving both U.S. and Canadian law enforcement agencies in 2005. He's been fighting extradition ever since, but on Wednesday he said he now realizes it's a fight he's not going to win. \"Ultimately my lawyer is convinced that the Canadian government has never refused an extradition request from the United States and it's not going to start now,\" he said. \"Sometimes you have to face up to the reality of what's going to happen, and under this scenario I may be free out of prison in two or three or four years,\" he said. Without the deal, Emery said, he would be facing much more time in jail. \"This is a preferential arrangement to the not-so-good-arrangement that would see me spend 10, 20, 30 years in a U.S. federal penitentiary, foreseeably the rest of my life, and that doesn't give a person a lot of hope,\" he said. Prepared to do time \"The DA wants to paint me as a large player providing a lot of marijuana to people, and we'll bring up that it was only seeds and it was totally transparent. It was done in Canada out in the open for 10 or 12 years,\" he told CBC News during an interview at the busy downtown Vancouver hemp store he still operates. \"I didn't keep any of the money  $4 million. I gave it all away to activist groups around the world, so my motives are unusual, so that does mitigate in sentencing,\" said Emery, who frequently ran in provincial and federal elections as the leader of the Marijuana Party. But the man who once spent more than two months in a Canadian prison for passing a joint to an undercover officer is now preparing for a much longer stay in a U.S. prison. \"You've got to keep busy in jail. You've got to be reading, in my case writing. I'll be learning Spanish, French. You've got to have projects,\" he said. That's what happens when you have Stephen Harper in Parliament. Stupid Conservative Government. It's disgusting that instead of dealing with Mr. Emery like a responsible government should - we pass him off like a hot potato to the USA for them to deal with, and to be prosecuted under their laws where he has no bargaining power and fewer rights. *spits* I hate seein the prince go to jail                                       twas a stupid mistake though I can't believe it's actually going to happen. I remember reading about this forever ago and thinking \"ah he'll be fine\" fuck man. Fuck america. Fuck america. No, America is alright, but fuck the American government. Fuck the Canadian government too. haha They're the ones who're gonna agree to extradite him, in the first place. It's fookin rediculous that he will be sentenced to a few years in jail just for selling seeds. He should be praised, instead of martyred No, America is alright, but fuck the American government. Fuck the Canadian government too. haha They're the ones who're gonna agree to extradite him, in the first place. It's fookin rediculous that he will be sentenced to a few years in jail just for selling seeds. He should be praised, instead of martyred Fuck governments in general.

M E D I A A D V I S O R Y For Immediate Release  September 19, 2013 Contact: Roger Kerson, 734.645.0535, roger.kerson@gmail.com Phil Smith: 571-345-8338; psmith@umwa.org Advisory for Tuesday, Sept. 24th @ 10 am Mine Workers and Supporters to Encircle Peabody HQ in Downtown St. Louis Union says retirees and dependents must receive health care benefits earned during decades of labor in company mines St. Louis  Thousands of mine workers and supporters plan to march around the headquarters of Peabody Energy in St. Louis this coming Tuesday, Sept. 24th. The event is the latest in a series of protests directed at the worlds largest private-sector coal company, which reported $90 million in net income in the second quarter of 2013. Peabody executives, however, are so far refusing to honor the companys obligation to provide critically needed health care benefits for retired miners. Who: Mine workers and supporters, including: · Cecil Roberts, International President, UMWA · Hugh McVey, President, Missouri AFL-CIO · Terrence Melvin, President, Coalition of Black Trade Unionists · Claude Cummings, Vice President, CWA District 6 · Rev. Jonathan Stratton, Episcopal Diocese of Missouri What: March encircling Peabody Headquarters, calling for the company to honor its obligations to retired miners and their dependents. When: Tuesday, September 24th, 10 am (Central Time) Where: March to begin at Crowne Plaza Hotel, 200 N. Fourth Street. Marchers will proceed on Pine St. to Broadway, to Market. Then on Market Street to circle around Peabody headquarters along Market, Eighth, Chestnut and Seventh Streets. Marchers will then proceed to Kiener Plaza for a rally. The Patriot Coal chapter of this fight is behind us, now its time for Peabody Energy and Arch Coal to meet their responsibilities, said UMWA President Roberts. Last month, UWMA members approved a settlement with Patriot Coal, a company created by Peabody in 2007, which among other provisions established a mechanism for payment of health care benefits for retired miners. However, long-term funding for those benefits has not been secured. The union also won a court ruling in August establishing Peabodys continued obligations to 3,100 miners and dependents, whose benefits remained with Peabody at the time of the Patriot spinoff. Arch Coal, another profitable company, dumped its retiree obligations into a company called Magnum Coal in 2005. Magnum was subsequently acquired by Patriot, which entered bankruptcy reorganization last year. This fight is anything but over, said Roberts. Executives of these companies have to understand that miners and their families know the real story of what happened here  and because of our efforts, so do millions of working people across the country. Men and women worked underground for decades to earn these benefits. These companies are profitable, and they must step up to meet their obligations to these retirees. The unions ongoing effort to win full benefits for all affected retired miners includes a lawsuit against Peabody and Arch, filed in West Virginia; legislation in Congress to aid retired miners and their dependents, sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats; and an ongoing public education, advertising and community action campaign. Additional information is available at FairnessAtPatriot.org. Kick Now let's protect the miners' jobs too. New anti-coal regulations will kill jobs in West Virginia, Kentucky, and nationwide. Our government is supposed to be by and for the people.

In a February 13, 1973 conversation, Colson told Nixon that he had always had a little prejudice. Plotz reports that Colson sought to hire Teamsters thugs to beat up anti-war demonstrators. Colson also proposed firebombing the Brookings Institution and stealing politically damaging documents while firefighters put the fire out. Colson's voice, from archives from April 1969, was heard in the 2004 movie Going Upriver deprecating the anti-war efforts of John Kerry. Colson's orders were to \"destroy the young demagogue before he becomes another Ralph Nader.\" In a phone conversation with Nixon on April 28, 1971, Colson said, \"This fellow Kerry that they had on last week...He turns out to be really quite a phony.\" Watergate and Ellsberg scandals Colson also became involved in the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP or CREEP). At a CRP meeting on March 21, 1971, it was agreed to spend $250,000 on \"intelligence gathering\" on the Democratic Party. Colson and John Ehrlichman appointed E. Howard Hunt to the White House Special Operations Unit (the so-called \"Plumbers\") which had been organized to stop leaks in the Nixon administration. Hunt headed up the Plumbers' burglary of Pentagon Papers-leaker Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office in September 1971. The Pentagon Papers were military documents about the Vietnam War which helped increase opposition to the war. Colson hoped that revelations about Ellsberg could be used to discredit the anti-Vietnam War cause.

{"doc_id": "cca700aed62fd497e64e507752409b41", "document": "I know I may be stepping into a minefield here but I have to ask this. I was listening to NPR on the way to work today and one of their reporters was at a celebration that Huckabee held after winning in Iowa. The reporter was clearly next to a female who was praying in a loud, almost ranting type of way, asking God to lift up Mike Huckabee, etc etc and asking God to make sure that Huckabee is proud of being a pastor and how we are to select leaders who are spiritual, etc. I would have given anything to see a videotape of it The press can do a remarkable job of taking even the most innocuous instance and sometimes just by broadcasting it, make it look really bad. This was one of those cases. I asked some fellow Christians about a thesis that was forming in my mind about the possibility of Huckabee being elected. I specifically asked if we, as Christians, have become so pious that we believe that the only person who can lead this country is an ordained Baptist minister. I mean, think about that for a second. The field is wide open, yet why is it that the Christians pile on Mike Huckabee's wagon and openly snub other people, like Mitt Romney? It would be wrong of us to issue a call to Mitt Romney to be the pastor of First Baptist church. Clearly he does not share our doctrine. But does that mean that we shouldn't support him? Or what about Giuliani? He has been married and divorced several times. But I would remind folks that the divorce rate is the same for those of us who are \"churched\" and those who are unchurched. Yet it seems like we judge him on his divorces. Does anybody really believe that if Giuliani gets elected that his wife is going to divorce the powerful person in the country while he is in office? Not a chance. Giuliani's marriage is not going to end in divorce (hopefully ever) but especially not if he gets elected. Bottom line? There is no way that a if a republican gets elected that they will go act in a manner contrary to conservative opinions on abortion, gay marriage, etc. And by the way, there are bigger issues than those. To do so would be the death knell of the republicans. I'm not saying that I endorse any of these candidates. But I do believe that we shouldn't jump on Huckabee's wagon just because he is a pastor. So if what I said is true about what a republican president will not do, then why the support for Huckabee? Are some of us naive? Am I the only one who feels that he is using Jesus as a prop in the election (think of his Christmas day ad if you disagree). I would sooner walk across hot coals than attend a Huckabee rally and rant and cheer when he speaks of values. Same thing goes for most rallies by most of today's presidential candidates. They are using us as props and we need to be resistant of that. To put it another way, if you had attended a rally for George W Bush back in 2000, would you dare tell anyone now that you were there back then? Probably not. And for the young lady who was probably miked for her prayer, I would respectfully ask that she keep it down. Showboating like that, I believe, only pushes us backward in our ability to spread the Gospel and bring more people to Christ. Wait, what exactly is your question? Are people naive? Oohhhhhh yeah. But maybe that isn't your question. My question is why are people jumping on Huckabee's bandwagon. The rest of it was food for thought. Maybe they found someone they can identify with that is in the race that isn't a slick New England republican-poser politician or a beltway insider or a fringe nutjob... Maybe you are right. My concern is the inordinate level of support he is drawing from Christian evangelicals. He does not have the broad support that Obama has. With Huck, it is very concentrated. Maybe you are right. My concern is the inordinate level of support he is drawing from Christian evangelicals. He does not have the broad support that Obama has. With Huck, it is very concentrated. It's an election, people vote for they believe is the right guy (or gal)...he reflects evangelical beliefs, by and large the others are snakey, so who do ya think they're gonna vote for? More politicians than not are like that. But they are going for him without so much as a glance at his record. Look at all the people he paroled while in Arkansas. I heard it was half the state. Okay, I'm kidding. The guy doesn't have that great of a record. Just because he shares our beliefs doesn't entitle him to the presidency. Separation of church and state exists for a reason and don't think for a second that if he gets in that the lines won't become dangerously blurred.", "event_args": [{"start": 101, "end": 103, "trigger": "way", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 113, "end": 117, "mention": "today", "role": "time"}, {"start": 90, "end": 92, "mention": "NPR", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 71, "end": 71, "mention": "I", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 438, "end": 443, "trigger": "select", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 413, "end": 418, "mention": "pastor", "role": "position"}, {"start": 333, "end": 340, "mention": "Huckabee", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 629, "end": 640, "trigger": "broadcasting", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 702, "end": 706, "trigger": "asked", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 700, "end": 700, "mention": "I", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 814, "end": 820, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 799, "end": 806, "mention": "Huckabee", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1185, "end": 1189, "trigger": "issue", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1179, "end": 1180, "mention": "us", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1387, "trigger": "married", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1369, "end": 1370, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1400, "trigger": "divorced", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1369, "end": 1370, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1457, "trigger": "divorce", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1586, "trigger": "divorces", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1575, "end": 1577, "mention": "his", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1645, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1625, "end": 1632, "mention": "Giuliani", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1673, "end": 1679, "trigger": "divorce", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1625, "end": 1632, "mention": "Giuliani", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1771, "trigger": "marriage", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1753, "end": 1760, "mention": "Giuliani", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1802, "trigger": "divorce", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1753, "end": 1760, "mention": "Giuliani", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1857, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1843, "end": 1844, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1917, "end": 1923, "trigger": "elected", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 2624, "end": 2629, "trigger": "speaks", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2611, "end": 2612, "mention": "he", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 2881, "end": 2884, "trigger": "tell", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 2886, "end": 2891, "mention": "anyone", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 2809, "end": 2811, "mention": "you", "role": "entity"}, {"start": 2893, "end": 2895, "mention": "now", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 4273, "end": 4279, "trigger": "paroled", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 4290, "end": 4297, "mention": "Arkansas", "role": "place"}]}]}

The story seems strangly one sided. It seems like the whole thing is fdrom Mommy's POV. I think she may have just seen a cool opportunity to make a quick 200 grand.

That is crazy. Yeah, anybody else catch the pants-down aspect? This was a sexual assault. Ewww... I'm against corporal punishment in general, but this was rather disturbing. First off a 16 year old is more adult than child. Second, there is nothing sexual about paddling a bare bottom unless your into that sort of thing. It was a stupid idea, from a small town cop. Can't say I'm amazed, disturbed or even surprised. Hi, This is what you get for speeding. A spanking. Police sued over alleged paddling of teen for speeding ticket. I think the police went overboard with the spanking of this 16 year old. What do you think of this? Thanks, Robert. Heck yeah! I think it is hilarious and they should take up the policy. Most kids my age are brash and arrogant and could probably use a paddling. Yeah, at first glance I found the idea to be quite funny. Then I read the article and the mother saying her son, no wait child, was \"tramatized\". Yeah, then they called the 16 guy a \"child\". Hmm, lets see: consider myself a man, 2 year age difference, *thinks*.... Aha! I have it! The guy really is a child becuase he was \"tramatized\" over a paddling. What I find interesting is that the 16 year old allowed the cop to paddle him, not once, but three times. I'm sorry, but this is both funny and sick at the same time. The mother probably agreed so that whatever the child had done would 'go away' and their insurance wouldn't get higher. The guy, or 'child', probably didn't want to pay the ticket and figured that the 'paddling' would be like the ones his mom/dad probably gave him as a younger child. Lets face it, parents don't enjoy spanking their kids, as it causes them pain. I know for a FACT that my mom and dad didn't give me a 'thrashing' as a kid, but I sure didn't want to curse again after getting spanked for saying the word for a person with no father. The Police is honestly probably a very sick person. Not once have I EVER heard of a cop giving the people a 'choice' in their ticketing. He probably saw this as a way to get some of his rocks off, and took the risk. Now he's gotten introuble for it, and I hope that if his intentions were what I think they were, he gets fired. There is no need for spanking a 16 year old, let alone even THINKING of trying to do so bare bottom. ~shakes his head~ If I was this kid, I would never have agreed to it. Think of the humiliation this boy is going to have have to face in school. people always make things harder for themselves. Just pay the ticket and get over it. I know for a FACT that my mom and dad didn't give me a 'thrashing' as a kid, but I sure didn't want to curse again after getting spanked for saying the word for a person with no father. *chuckles* Auto filter at my board changes that to 'person of illegitimate parentage'. I don't know if the police wanted to do this to 'get his rocks off', but I do know that it was inapropriete. However, I think just about everyone went into fault here: the teenager twice (for speeding AND for agreeing to an alternative punnishment he must have known was illegal), the mother for agreeing to something like this and then sueing over it, and the chief of police for making up such a sick 'program' in the first place. Should the mother sue to get the police chief removed: yes, of course that man should be removed. Should she get even one dollar? NO!!

Police say Richard Manning pulled the trigger when Gallman got out of his car at South Moore Road and North Terrace Road. Gallman's wife, Anna was in the car. Manning drove away and changed cars, but police tracked him down. Gallman didn't make it. The alleged killer was a former sheriff's deputy and is a certified firearms instructor. The victim was unarmed. Just before he was shot by a stranger furious over a car accident, just before he lay bleeding to death next to his screaming wife, Alex Gallman had walked his kids into school. Many parents don't. They drive through the drop-off line, giving goodbye hugs and kisses from the front seat to the back. But not Alex. Maybe it was because coming up with tuition money to Brainerd Baptist School was no easy thing for the Gallmans, so walking his two boys into school was a way to soak it all up. Maybe it let him say thanks to their teachers. Maybe it was just because he loved -- really, really loved -- his kids. After all, he was their basketball coach. He went on classroom field trips, the lone dad among many moms. \"He was very soft-spoken and mild-mannered,\" Corcoran said of Alex. \"He got out and said, 'Calm down. You're scaring my wife. '... The guy shoots him. Manning has been charged with criminal homicide and aggravated assault. Alex, a personal trainer, was the main breadwinner. Anna works the dinner shift at Red Lobster. He was 39. There was no life insurance. I know some people in the area and the shooter has severe diabetes and was recently treated for cancer. He is in the hospital and may not live to stand trial. He probably had no business behind the wheel, much less behind a firearm. What a sick person. I hope he is never let out of prison. He has taken away a father and husband from a loving family because of his own poor self control.", "event_args": [{"start": 38, "end": 45, "trigger": "arrested", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 100, "end": 106, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 64, "end": 69, "mention": "murder", "role": "crime"}]}, {"start": 51, "end": 57, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 100, "end": 106, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}, {"start": 64, "end": 69, "mention": "murder", "role": "crime"}]}, {"start": 64, "end": 69, "trigger": "murder", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 64, "end": 69, "mention": "murder", "role": "crime"}, {"start": 100, "end": 106, "mention": "Tuesday", "role": "time"}]}, {"start": 136, "end": 153, "trigger": "pulled the trigger", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 276, "end": 285, "trigger": "drove away", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 268, "end": 274, "mention": "Manning", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 342, "end": 355, "trigger": "didn't make it", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 334, "end": 340, "mention": "Gallman", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 370, "end": 375, "trigger": "killer", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 383, "end": 388, "trigger": "former", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 490, "end": 493, "trigger": "shot", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 483, "end": 484, "mention": "he", "role": "target"}]}, {"start": 569, "end": 573, "trigger": "death", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 483, "end": 484, "mention": "he", "role": "victim"}]}, {"start": 620, "end": 625, "trigger": "walked", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 641, "end": 646, "mention": "school", "role": "destination"}]}, {"start": 674, "end": 678, "trigger": "drive", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 669, "end": 672, "mention": "They", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 821, "end": 827, "trigger": "tuition", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 888, "end": 895, "mention": "Gallmans", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 901, "end": 907, "trigger": "walking", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 888, "end": 895, "mention": "Gallmans", "role": "giver"}]}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1130, "trigger": "went", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1124, "end": 1125, "mention": "He", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1245, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1233, "end": 1240, "mention": "Corcoran", "role": "entity"}]}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1275, "trigger": "said", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1257, "end": 1258, "mention": "He", "role": "agent"}]}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1332, "trigger": "shoots", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1334, "end": 1336, "mention": "him", "role": "target"}]}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1362, "trigger": "charged", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1339, "end": 1345, "mention": "Manning", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1385, "trigger": "homicide", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1339, "end": 1345, "mention": "Manning", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1408, "trigger": "assault", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1339, "end": 1345, "mention": "Manning", "role": "attacker"}]}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1592, "trigger": "shooter", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": []}, {"start": 1677, "end": 1688, "trigger": "may not live", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1651, "end": 1652, "mention": "He", "role": "defendant"}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1671, "mention": "hospital", "role": "place"}]}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1703, "trigger": "trial", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1651, "end": 1652, "mention": "He", "role": "defendant"}]}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1825, "trigger": "let out", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1830, "end": 1835, "mention": "prison", "role": "origin"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1808, "mention": "he", "role": "person"}]}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1849, "trigger": "taken", "subtype": "NA", "arguments": [{"start": 1838, "end": 1839, "mention": "He", "role": "attacker"}]}]}
